{"description": "Dolibarr ERP/CRM 9.0.1 provides a module named website that provides for creation of public websites with a WYSIWYG editor. It was identified that the editor also allowed inclusion of dynamic code, which can lead to code execution on the host machine. An attacker has to check a setting on the same page, which specifies the inclusion of dynamic content. Thus, a lower privileged user of the application can execute code under the context and permissions of the underlying web server.", "methods": ["Used a WYSIWYG editor to inject code into a web application.", "Leveraged a setting to include dynamic content.", "Executed code under the context and permissions of the underlying web server.", "Exploited a module in Dolibarr ERP/CRM to inject code."]}
