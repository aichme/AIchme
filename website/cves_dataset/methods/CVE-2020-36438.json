{"description": "tiny_future contains a light-weight implementation of Futures. The Future type it has lacked bound on its Send and Sync traits. This allows for a bug where non-thread safe types such as Cell can be used in Futures and cause data races in concurrent programs. The flaw was corrected in commit `c791919` by adding trait bounds to Future's Send and Sync.", "methods": ["Used a data race vulnerability in the tiny_future library.", "Failed to implement thread safety in the Future type.", "Used a non-thread safe type (Cell) in a concurrent program."]}
