However, an attacker with credentials could damage the integrity of the Koji system.\n\n### Workaround\nThere is no known workaround. All Koji admins are encouraged to update to a fixed version as soon as possible.\n\n### Fix\nKoji versions 1.14.3, 1.15.3, 1.16.3, 1.17.1, and 1.18.1 all include patches to solve this vulnerability.\n\n", "methods": ["Allows an attacker to choose an arbitrary destination for the uploaded file.", "Allows an attacker with credentials to damage the integrity of the Koji system."]}
