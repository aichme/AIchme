{"description": "A grpc-swift server is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via a reachable assertion. This was due to incorrect logic when handling `GOAWAY` frames.\n\nThe attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to construct and send the required sequence of frames. The impact on availability is high as the server will crash, dropping all in flight connections and requests.\n\nThe issue was discovered by automated fuzz testing and is resolved by fixing the relevant state handling code.", "methods": ["Used a denial of service attack via a reachable assertion.", "Exploited incorrect logic in handling GOAWAY frames.", "Used automated fuzz testing to discover the vulnerability.", "Crashed the grpc-swift server, dropping all in-flight connections and requests."]}
