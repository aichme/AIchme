Users have cluster-wide list or watch authorization on one of those custom resources. 3. The same users are not authorized to read another custom resource in the same API group.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in Kubernetes to read unauthorized custom resources.", "Leveraged cluster-wide list or watch authorization to bypass access controls.", "Exploited the presence of multiple CustomResourceDefinitions sharing the same API group.", "Exploited the lack of authorization to read another custom resource in the same API group."]}
