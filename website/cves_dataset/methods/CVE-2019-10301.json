{"description": "Jenkins GitLab Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.\n\nThis form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.", "methods": ["Used a missing permission check in a method to connect to an attacker-specified URL with attacker-specified credentials IDs.", "Used a cross-site request forgery vulnerability to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.", "Implemented a fix to require POST requests for the form validation method.", "Implemented a fix to require Overall/Administer permissions for the form validation method."]}
