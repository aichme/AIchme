{"description": "### Impact\n\nThis may impact users that use Shescape on Windows in a threaded context (e.g. using [Worker threads](https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html)). The vulnerability can result in Shescape escaping (or quoting) for the wrong shell, thus allowing attackers to bypass protections depending on the combination of expected and used shell.\n\nThis snippet demonstrates a vulnerable use of Shescape:\n\n```javascript\n// vulnerable.js\n\nimport { exec } from \"node:child_process\";\nimport { Worker, isMainThread } from 'node:worker_threads';\n\nimport * as shescape from \"shescape\";\n\nif (isMainThread) {\n  // 1. Something like a worker thread must be used. The reason being that they\n  // unexpectedly change environment variable names on Windows.\n  new Worker(\"./vulnerable.js\");\n} else {\n  // 2. Example configuration that's problematic. In this setup example the\n  // expected default system shell is CMD. We configure the use of PowerShell.\n  // Shescape will fail to look up PowerShell and default to escaping for CMD\n  // instead, resulting in the vulnerability.\n  const options = {\n    shell: \"powershell\",\n    interpolation: true,\n  };\n\n  // 3. Using shescape to protect against attacks, this is correct.\n  const escaped = shescape.escape(\"&& ls\", options);\n\n  // 4. Invoking a command with the escaped user input, this is vulnerable in\n  // this case.\n  exec(`echo Hello ${escaped}`, options, (error, stdout) => {\n    if (error) {\n      console.error(`An error occurred: ${error}`);\n    } else {\n      console.log(stdout);\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been patched in [v1.7.4](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.7.4) which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you are impacted there is no workaround possible.\n\n### References\n\n- Shescape Pull Request [#1142](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/1142)\n- Shescape commit [`0b976da`](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/commit/0b976dab645abf45ffd85e74a8c6e51ee2f42d63)\n- Shescape release [v1.7.4](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.7.4)\n\n### For more information\n\n- Comment on Pull Request [#1142](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/pull/1142)\n- Comment on commit [`0b976da`](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/commit/0b976dab645abf45ffd85e74a8c6e51ee2f42d63)\n- Open an issue at [https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/issues](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) (New issue > Question > Get started)", "methods": ["Used JavaScript to create a worker thread on Windows.", "Used the `exec` function to execute a command in a shell.", "Used the `shescape` library to escape user input, but incorrectly configured it to use PowerShell instead of the default shell.", "Used the `echo` command to print output to the console.", "Used the `console.log` function to print output to the console.", "Used the `console.error` function to print error messages to the console.", "Used the `Worker` class to create a worker thread.", "Used the `isMainThread` function to check if the current thread is the main thread.", "Used the `node:child_process` module to execute a command in a shell.", "Used the `node:worker_threads` module to create a worker thread.", "Used the `shescape.escape` function to escape user input.", "Used the `exec` function with the `options` object to execute a command in a shell.", "Used the `options` object to configure the shell and interpolation.", "Used the `stdout` variable to capture the output of the command.", "Used the `error` variable to capture any errors that occur while executing the command."]}
