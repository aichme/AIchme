{"description": "### Impact\nThere is a hard-coded cryptographic key in the code base which can be exploited to run admin commands on a remote server, if you know the address and username of the admin. This effects the server (netmaker) component, and not clients.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in Netmaker v0.8.5, v0.9.4, and v0.10.0. If you are running these versions, the fix is to perform the following:\n\n1. docker-compose down\n2. docker pull gravitl/netmaker:( version )\n3. docker-compose up -d\n\n#### Additional Information\nIf you are running **any other version**, you will need to upgrade to one of these three versions. If you have a special circumstance that requires running a different version, let us know and we may be able to build a custom patch.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [info@gravitl.com](mailto:info@gravitl.com)\n", "methods": ["Hard-coded cryptographic key used to run admin commands on a remote server.", "Exploitation of a hard-coded cryptographic key to gain remote access.", "Use of a known vulnerability in the server component (netmaker) to gain remote access."]}
