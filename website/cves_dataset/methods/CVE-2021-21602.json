{"description": "The file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and `$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/` follows symbolic links to locations outside the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier.\n\nThis allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to control workspace contents (e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents) to create symbolic links that allow them to access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.\n\nThis issue is caused by an incomplete fix for SECURITY-904 / CVE-2018-1000862 in the [2018-12-08 security advisory](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-12-05/#SECURITY-904).\n\nJenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 no longer supports symlinks in workspace browsers. While they may still exist on the file system, they are no longer shown on the UI, accessible via URLs, or included in directory content downloads.\n\nThis fix only changes the behavior of the Jenkins UI. Archiving artifacts still behaves as before.", "methods": ["Created symbolic links to access files outside workspaces.", "Leveraged incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (SECURITY-904 / CVE-2018-1000862).", "Exploited incomplete fix to access files outside workspaces.", "Used Job/Workspace permission to control workspace contents.", "Used ability to change SCM contents to create symbolic links.", "Created symlinks to access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser."]}
