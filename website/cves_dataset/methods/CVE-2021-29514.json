{"description": "### Impact\nIf the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid [`SparseTensor`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/SparseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.RaggedBincount(splits=[7,8], values= [5, 16, 51, 76, 29, 27, 54, 95],\\\n                          size= 59, weights= [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\\\n                          binary_output=False)\n```\n\nThis will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer in the [implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8b677d79167799f71c42fd3fa074476e0295413a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L446):\n    \n```cc \n    for (int idx = 0; idx < num_values; ++idx) {\n      while (idx >= splits(batch_idx)) {\n        batch_idx++;\n      }\n      ...\n      if (bin < size) {\n        if (binary_output_) {\n          out(batch_idx - 1, bin) = T(1);\n        } else {\n          T value = (weights_size > 0) ? weights(idx) : T(1);\n          out(batch_idx - 1, bin) += value;\n        }\n      } \n    }\n```\n\nBefore the `for` loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The attacker sets `splits(0)` to be 7, hence the `while` loop does not execute and `batch_idx` remains 0. This then results in writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/eebb96c2830d48597d055d247c0e9aebaea94cd5).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap out of bounds write in `RaggedBinCount` to trigger a buffer overflow.", "Trigger a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer.", "Use of a while loop to access memory outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor buffer.", "Writing to `out(-1, bin)`, which is before the heap allocated buffer for the output tensor."]}
