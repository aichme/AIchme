The attacker can trick the user, for instance through a broken `<img>` tag pointing at the victim's phpMyAdmin database, and the attacker can potentially deliver a payload (such as a specific INSERT or DELETE statement) to the victim.", "methods": ["Tricked a user into performing an unintended action through a broken `<img>` tag.", "Delivered a payload (e.g., INSERT or DELETE statement) to the victim."]}
