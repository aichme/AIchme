{"description": "### Impact\nThe `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning of the `values` tensor. Thus, the [following code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L248-L265\n) sets up conditions to cause a heap buffer overflow:\n```cc\n    auto per_batch_counts = BatchedMap<W>(num_batches);\n    int batch_idx = 0;\n    for (int idx = 0; idx < num_values; ++idx) {\n      while (idx >= splits_values(batch_idx)) {\n        batch_idx++;\n      }\n      const auto& value = values_values(idx);\n      if (value >= 0 && (maxlength_ <= 0 || value < maxlength_)) {\n        per_batch_counts[batch_idx - 1][value] = 1;\n      }\n    }\n```\n\nA `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector where each element is a hashmap. However, if the first element of `splits_values` is not 0, `batch_idx` will never be 1, hence there will be no hashmap at index 0 in `per_batch_counts`. Trying to access that in the user code results in a segmentation fault.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and will release a patch release.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 2.3.1.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability is a variant of [GHSA-p5f8-gfw5-33w4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-p5f8-gfw5-33w4)", "methods": ["Heap buffer overflow via a segmentation fault in the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation.", "Lack of input validation in the `RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementation."]}
