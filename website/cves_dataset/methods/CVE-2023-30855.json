{"description": "### Impact\nThe impact of this path traversal and arbitrary extension is limited (creation of arbitrary files and appending data to existing files) but when combined with the SQL Injection, the exported data `RESTRICTED DIFFUSION 9 / 9` can be controlled and a webshell can be uploaded. Attackers can use that to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server with the permissions of the webserver.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to version 10.5.18 or apply this patch manually https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/7f788fa44bc18bc1c9182c25e26b770a1d30b62f.patch\n\n### Workarounds\nApply patch https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/7f788fa44bc18bc1c9182c25e26b770a1d30b62f.patch manually.\n\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/14498\n", "methods": ["Used path traversal to create arbitrary files and append data to existing files.", "Used SQL Injection to control exported data.", "Executed arbitrary PHP code on the server with webserver permissions.", "Uploaded a webshell to the server."]}
