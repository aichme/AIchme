{"description": "### Impact\nUnauthorised users can access the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where:\n- the vulnerable homeserver is in the room; and\n- untrusted users are permitted to create groups (communities).\n\nBy default, only homeserver administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators can already access this information in the database or using the admin API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting `enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted.\n\n### Patches\nServer administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher.\n\n### Workarounds\nServer administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent creation of groups by non-administrators.\n\nAdministrators that are using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality, block the following endpoints:\n* `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms`\n* `/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`\n\n### References\nn/a\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at security@matrix.org.\n", "methods": ["Exposes sensitive information in an unauthorized manner.", "Access to sensitive information through database or admin API.", "Modification of configuration settings to enable group creation.", "Blocking of specific endpoints to prevent unauthorized access.", "Use of a reverse proxy to block access to sensitive information."]}
