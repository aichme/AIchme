{"description": "### Impact\nImproperly formed beacon events (from [MSC3488](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3488)) can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer.\n\n### Patches\nThis is patched in matrix-js-sdk v19.7.0\n\n### Workarounds\nRedacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client can often fix it. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will fix the further perceived issues.\n\nDowngrading to an unaffected version, noting that such a version may be subject to other vulnerabilities, will additionally resolve the issue.\n\n### References\nN/A - This was a logic error in the SDK.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please email us at [security at matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).\n", "methods": ["Improperly formed beacon events can disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly.", "Disrupting the matrix-js-sdk can impact the consumer's ability to process data safely.", "The matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data.", "Redacting applicable events can often fix the issue.", "Redacting events and clearing all storage can resolve the issue.", "Downgrading to an unaffected version can resolve the issue."]}
