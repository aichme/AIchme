{"description": "### Impact\nTensorFlow's Grappler optimizer has a [use of unitialized variable](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3457a2b122e50b4d44ceaaed5a663d635e5c22df/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/auto_parallel.cc#L155-L164):\n\n```cc\n  const NodeDef* dequeue_node;\n  for (const auto& train_node : train_nodes) {\n    if (IsDequeueOp(*train_node)) {\n      dequeue_node = train_node;\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n\n  if (dequeue_node) {\n    ...\n  }\n```\n\nIf the `train_nodes` vector (obtained from the saved model that gets optimized) does not contain a `Dequeue` node, then `dequeue_node` is left unitialized.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [68867bf01239d9e1048f98cbad185bf4761bedd3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/68867bf01239d9e1048f98cbad185bf4761bedd3).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Qian Feng from Baidu Security Team.\n", "methods": ["Used uninitialized value in code.", "Failed to handle edge case in code.", "Failed to validate user input.", "Failed to sanitize user input.", "Failed to validate data from saved model.", "Failed to initialize variable before use."]}
