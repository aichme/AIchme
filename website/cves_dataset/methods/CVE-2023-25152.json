Information on how the exploitation of this vulnerability works will be released on February 24th, 2023 in North America.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been resolved in version `v1.11.3` of Wings, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series in `v1.7.3`.\n\nAnyone running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to `v1.11.3` and anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.3`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone at this time.", "methods": ["Creates new files on the host system that previously did not exist.", "Allows attackers to change resource allocations.", "Promotes containers to privileged mode.", "Adds SSH authorized keys to allow remote shell access.", "Uses UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following."]}
