{"description": "Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 451.vf1a_a_4f405289 and earlier does not restrict or sanitize the optionally specified ID of the `input` step. This ID is used for the URLs that process user interactions for the given `input` step (proceed or abort) and is not correctly encoded.\n\nThis allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to have Jenkins build URLs from `input` step IDs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL in Jenkins when the `input` step is interacted with.\n\nPipeline: Input Step Plugin 456.vd8a_957db_5b_e9 limits the characters that can be used for the ID of `input` steps in Pipelines to alphanumeric characters and URL-safe punctuation. Pipelines with `input` steps having IDs with prohibited characters will fail with an error.\n\nThis includes Pipelines that have already been started but not finished before Jenkins is restarted to apply this update.\n\n[Pipeline: Declarative Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-model-definition/) provides an `input` directive that is internally using the `input` step, and specifies a non-default ID if not user-defined. Pipeline: Declarative Plugin 2.2114.v2654ca_721309 and earlier may specify values incompatible with this new restriction on legal values: `input` directives in a `stage` use the stage name (which may include prohibited characters) and `input` directives in a `matrix` will use a value generated from the matrix axis values (which always includes prohibited characters). Administrators are advised to update Pipeline: Input Step Plugin and Pipeline: Declarative Plugin at the same time, ideally while no Pipelines are running.", "methods": ["Bypasses CSRF protection for any URL in Jenkins.", "Configures Pipelines to build URLs from `input` step IDs that bypass CSRF protection.", "Uses non-encoded URLs to process user interactions.", "Allows attackers to interact with target URLs without CSRF protection.", "Fails Pipelines with `input` steps having IDs with prohibited characters.", "Specifies values incompatible with new restriction on legal values for `input` directives.", "Uses stage name or matrix axis values that include prohibited characters for `input` directives."]}
