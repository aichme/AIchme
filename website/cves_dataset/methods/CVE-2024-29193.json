{"description": "gotortc is a camera streaming application. Versions 1.8.5 and prior are vulnerable to DOM-based cross-site scripting. The index page (`index.html`) shows the available streams by fetching the API in the client side. Then, it uses `Object.entries` to iterate over the result whose first item (`name`) gets appended using `innerHTML`. In the event of a victim visiting the server in question, their browser will execute the request against the go2rtc instance. After the request, the browser will be redirected to go2rtc, in which the XSS would be executed in the context of go2rtc\u2019s origin.", "methods": ["Used DOM-based cross-site scripting to execute malicious code in the context of the go2rtc origin.", "Used the `innerHTML` method to inject malicious code into the index page.", "Used the `Object.entries` method to iterate over the result and append malicious code.", "Used the `index.html` page to fetch the API and execute the request.", "Used the browser to execute the request against the go2rtc instance."]}
