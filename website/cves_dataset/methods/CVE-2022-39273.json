{"description": "### Impact\nUsers who enable the default [Flyte\u2019s authorization server](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/cluster_config/auth_setup.html#oauth2-authorization-server) without changing the default clientid hashes will be exposed to the public internet.\n\nIn an effort to make enabling authentication easier for Flyte administrators, the default configuration for Flyte Admin allows access for Flyte Propeller even after turning on authentication via a hardcoded hashed password.  This password is also set on the default Flyte Propeller configmap in the various Flyte Helm charts.  Users who enable auth but do not override this setting in Flyte Admin\u2019s configuration may unknowingly allow public traffic in by way of this default password with attackers effectively impersonating propeller.  This only applies to users who have not specified the ExternalAuthorizationServer setting.  Using an external auth server automatically turns off this default configuration is not susceptible to this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n1.1.44\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers should manually set the staticClients in the selfAuthServer section of their configuration if they intend to rely on Admin\u2019s internal auth server.  \n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/flyteorg/flyteadmin/pull/478\nhttps://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/deployment/cluster_config/auth_setup.html#oauth2-authorization-server \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Flyte](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte/issues)\n* Email us [here](mailto:admin@flyte.org)", "methods": ["Users who enable the default Flyte authorization server without changing the default clientid hashes will be exposed to the public internet.", "Default configuration for Flyte Admin allows access for Flyte Propeller even after turning on authentication via a hardcoded hashed password.", "Users who enable auth but do not override this setting in Flyte Admin\u2019s configuration may unknowingly allow public traffic in by way of this default password.", "Attackers can impersonate propeller.", "Using an external auth server automatically turns off this default configuration.", "Users should manually set the staticClients in the selfAuthServer section of their configuration if they intend to rely on Admin\u2019s internal auth server."]}
