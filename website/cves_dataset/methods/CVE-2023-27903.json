{"description": "When triggering a build from the Jenkins CLI, Jenkins creates a temporary file on the controller if a file parameter is provided through the CLI\u2019s standard input.\n\nJenkins 2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier, and , and LTS prior to 2.387.1 creates this temporary file in the default temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files.\n\nIf these permissions are overly permissive, they may allow attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the file before it is used in the build.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects operating systems using a shared temporary directory for all users (typically Linux). Additionally, the default permissions for newly created files generally only allows attackers to read the temporary file.\nJenkins 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 creates the temporary file with more restrictive permissions.\n\nAs a workaround, you can set a different path as your default temporary directory using the Java system property java.io.tmpdir, if you\u2019re concerned about this issue but unable to immediately update Jenkins.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in Jenkins Core to read and write a temporary file.", "Exploited overly permissive file permissions on a shared temporary directory.", "Used a shared temporary directory for all users.", "Created a temporary file with default permissions.", "Created a temporary file in a default temporary directory.", "Used a default temporary directory with overly permissive permissions."]}
