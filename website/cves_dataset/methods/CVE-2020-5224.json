{"description": "### Impact\nThe views provided by django-user-sessions allow users to terminate specific sessions. The session key is used to identify sessions, and thus included in the rendered HTML. In itself this is not a problem. However if the website has an XSS vulnerability, the session key could be extracted by the attacker and a session takeover could happen.\n\n### Patches\nPatch is under way.\n\n### Workarounds\nRemove the session_key from the template.\n\n### References\n_None._\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Bouke/django-user-sessions](https://github.com/Bouke/django-user-sessions/issues)\n* Email us at [bouke@haarsma.eu](mailto:bouke@haarsma.eu)", "methods": ["Session key exposure through session list in Django User Sessions.", "Session key could be extracted by the attacker through an XSS vulnerability.", "Session takeover could happen if the session key is extracted."]}
