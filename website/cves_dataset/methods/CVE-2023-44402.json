{"description": "### Impact\nThis only impacts apps that have the `embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation` and `onlyLoadAppFromAsar` [fuses](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/fuses) enabled.  Apps without these fuses enabled are not impacted.  This issue is specific to macOS as these fuses are only currently supported on macOS.\n\nSpecifically this issue can only be exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has write access too.  i.e. the ability to edit files inside the `resources` folder in your app installation on Windows which these fuses are supposed to protect against.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched version of Electron.\n\n### Fixed Versions\n* `27.0.0-alpha.7`\n* `26.2.1`\n* `25.8.1`\n* `24.8.3`\n* `22.3.24`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org)", "methods": ["Bypassing integrity checks via filetype confusion in Electron apps on macOS.", "Exploiting write access to the app's resources folder to modify files.", "Using Electron's `embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation` and `onlyLoadAppFromAsar` fuses to bypass security features."]}
