{"description": "### Impact\nA malicious user can upload an SVG image containing JavaScript to their server. When matrix-media-repo is asked to serve that media via the `/_matrix/media/(r0|v3)/download` endpoint, it would be served with a `Content-Disposition` of `inline`. This can allow JavaScript to run in the browser if a client links to the `/download` endpoint directly.\n\nServer operators which do not share a domain between matrix-media-repo and other services are not affected, but are encouraged to upgrade regardless.\n\n### Patches\nhttps://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/commit/77ec2354e8f46d5ef149d1dcaf25f51c04149137 and https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/commit/bf8abdd7a5371118e280c65a8e0ec2b2e9bdaf59 fix the issue. Operators should upgrade to v1.3.0 as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe `Content-Disposition` header can be overridden by the reverse proxy in front of matrix-media-repo to always use `attachment`, defeating this issue at the cost of \"worse\" user experience when clicking download links.\n\n### References\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/script\n\n", "methods": ["Served malicious SVG images with JavaScript inline.", "Used the `/download` endpoint to serve media.", "Used the `Content-Disposition` header to execute JavaScript in the browser.", "Used a reverse proxy to override the `Content-Disposition` header."]}
