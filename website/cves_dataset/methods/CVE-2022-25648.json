{"description": "The package prior to v1.11.0 is vulnerable to Command Injection via git argument injection. When calling the `fetch(remote = 'origin', opts = {})` function, the remote parameter is passed to the `git fetch` subcommand in a way such that additional flags can be set. The additional flags can be used to perform a command injection.", "methods": ["Command injection via git argument injection."]}
