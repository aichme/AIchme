{"description": "### Impact\n\nShopware has a new Twig Tag `sw_silent_feature_call` which silences deprecation messages while triggered in this tag.\nIt accepts as parameter a string the feature flag name to silence, but this parameter is not escaped properly and allows execution of code.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to Shopware 6.6.5.1 or 6.5.8.13\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.2, 6.3,  and 6.4, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.\n", "methods": ["Used Server Side Template Injection in Twig.", "Executed code through a deprecation silence tag.", "Failed to properly escape a parameter in a Twig tag.", "Used a feature flag to execute code."]}
