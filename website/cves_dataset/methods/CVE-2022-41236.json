{"description": "Security Inspector Plugin 117.v6eecc36919c2 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows attackers to replace the generated report stored in a per-session cache and displayed to authorized users at the `\u2026\u200b/report` URL with a report based on attacker-specified report generation options. This could create confusion in users of the plugin who are expecting to see a different result. A security hardening since Jenkins 2.287 and LTS 2.277.2 prevents exploitation of this vulnerability for the _Single user, multiple jobs_ report however, there is no fix at this time. Other report types are still affected.", "methods": ["Exploited a CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins Security Inspector plugin.", "Manipulated HTTP endpoints to replace a report with a malicious one.", "Used a security hardening to prevent exploitation for a specific report type.", "No exploitation of the vulnerability for the _Single user, multiple jobs_ report."]}
