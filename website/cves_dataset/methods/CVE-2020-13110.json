This may allow attackers to create a file with the same name in a folder that precedes the intended file in the DLL path search. Doing so would allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the machine.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.0.0 or later.", "methods": ["DLL Injection via loading DLLs without specifying a full path.", "Execution of arbitrary code on the machine."]}
