{"description": "An issue was discovered in Dask (aka python-dask) through 2021.09.1. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable library (Dask) to achieve remote code execution.", "Misconfigured Dask workers to listen on external interfaces.", "Exposed a port to allow remote access.", "Used a sophisticated attack to achieve remote code execution."]}
