{"description": "In the affected versions of this crate, LockWeak<T> unconditionally implemented Send with no trait bounds on T. LockWeak<T> doesn't own T and only provides &T. This allows concurrent access to a non-Sync T, which can cause undefined behavior like data races.", "methods": ["Allows concurrent access to a non-Sync T.", "Causes undefined behavior like data races."]}
