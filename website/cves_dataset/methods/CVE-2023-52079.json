{"description": "### Impact\nWhen decoding user supplied MessagePack messages, users can trigger stuck threads by crafting messages that keep the decoder stuck in a loop.\n\n### Patches\nThe fix is available in v1.10.1\n\n### Workarounds\nExploits seem to require structured cloning, replacing the 0x70 extension with your own (that throws an error or does something other than recursive referencing) should mitigate the issue.\n\n### References", "methods": ["Triggered infinite recursion in MessagePack decoder.", "Exploited structured cloning to trigger infinite recursion.", "Used crafted messages to cause stuck threads.", "Used MessagePack messages to trigger stuck threads.", "Replaced 0x70 extension to throw an error or prevent recursive referencing."]}
