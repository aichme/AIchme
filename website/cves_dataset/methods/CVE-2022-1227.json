{"description": "Podman is a tool for managing OCI containers and pods. A privilege escalation flaw was found in Podman. This flaw allows an attacker to publish a malicious image to a public registry. Once this image is downloaded by a potential victim, the vulnerability is triggered after a user runs the 'podman top' command. This action gives the attacker access to the host filesystem, leading to information disclosure or denial of service.", "methods": ["Published a malicious image to a public registry.", "Exploited a privilege escalation flaw.", "Gained access to the host filesystem.", "Triggered a vulnerability by running the 'podman top' command.", "Caused information disclosure or denial of service."]}
