{"description": "Previously, Puppet operated on the model that a node with a valid certificate was entitled to all information in the system and that a compromised certificate allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When a node's catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog can be retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. This issue can be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet 6.13.0 changes the default behavior for strict_hostname_checking from false to true. It is recommended that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that are not upgrading still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure secure behavior.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in certificate validation in Puppet.", "Used a compromised certificate to gain access to the system.", "Modified facts for a Puppet run to retrieve a different node's catalog.", "Leveraged a default node's catalog to gain unauthorized access.", "Failed to set `strict_hostname_checking = true` in `puppet.conf`."]}
