The policy ensures pods running with a service account may only reference secrets specified in the service account\u2019s secrets field. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if the ServiceAccount admission plugin and the `kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets` annotation are used together with ephemeral containers.\n\n", "methods": ["Bypasses mountable secrets policy by using ephemeral containers.", "Exploits ServiceAccount admission plugin vulnerability.", "Uses Kubernetes.io/enforce-mountable-secrets annotation."]}
