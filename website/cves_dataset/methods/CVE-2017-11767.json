{"description": "ChakraCore allows an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user, due to the way that the ChakraCore scripting engine handles objects in memory. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in ChakraCore to gain elevated privileges.", "Escalated privileges to gain control of the system.", "Installed malicious programs.", "Viewed, changed, or deleted data.", "Created new accounts with full user rights."]}
