{"description": "### Impact\nA bug was found in containerd where container root directories and some plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to these version when they are released and may restart containers or update directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nLimit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on container bundles directories. \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory: \n* Open an issue in [github.com/containerd/containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)\n", "methods": ["Unprivileged Linux users can traverse directory contents and execute programs.", "Unprivileged Linux users can discover, read, and modify files with matching UID.", "Unprivileged Linux users can discover and execute setuid programs.", "Unprivileged Linux users can access host directories with insufficiently restricted permissions.", "Unprivileged Linux users can access container root directories with insufficiently restricted permissions."]}
