{"description": "The implementation of impl Follow for bool allows to reinterpret arbitrary bytes as a bool.\n\nIn Rust bool has stringent requirements for its in-memory representation. Use of this function allows to violate these requirements and invoke undefined behaviour in safe code.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary code execution through undefined behavior in safe code.", "Violated memory safety requirements for bool data type."]}
