{"description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows a renderer with JS execution to obtain access to a new renderer process with `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` enabled which in turn allows effective access to `ipcRenderer`.\n\nPlease note the misleadingly named `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` option does not implicitly grant Node.js access rather it depends on the existing `sandbox` setting.  If your application is sandboxed then `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` just gives access to the sandboxed renderer APIs (which includes `ipcRenderer`).\n\nIf your application then additionally exposes IPC messages without IPC `senderFrame` validation that perform privileged actions or return confidential data this access to `ipcRenderer` can in turn compromise your application / user even with the sandbox enabled.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched and the following Electron versions contain the fix:\n\n* `18.0.0-beta.6`\n* `17.2.0`\n* `16.2.6`\n* `15.5.5`\n\n### Workarounds\nEnsure that all IPC message handlers appropriately validate `senderFrame` as per our [security tutorial here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/tutorial/security.md#17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in the IPC (Inter-Process Communication) system to obtain access to a new renderer process with nodeIntegrationInSubFrames enabled.", "Used the IPC system to access sandboxed renderer APIs, including ipcRenderer.", "Failed to validate IPC messages from unknown senders, allowing potential privilege escalation or data exposure.", "Leveraged the IPC system to compromise the application or user, even with the sandbox enabled."]}
