{"description": "An issue was discovered in the lever crate before 0.1.1 for Rust. AtomicBox<T> implements the Send and Sync traits for all types T. This allows non-Send types such as Rc and non-Sync types such as Cell to be used across thread boundaries which can trigger undefined behavior and memory corruption.", "methods": ["Implemented Send and Sync traits for non-compliant types (Rc and Cell) to bypass synchronization checks.", "Used data races to trigger undefined behavior and memory corruption."]}
