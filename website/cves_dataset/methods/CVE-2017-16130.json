{"description": "Affected versions of `exxxxxxxxxxx` resolve relative file paths, resulting in a directory traversal vulnerability. A malicious actor can use this vulnerability to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may result in the disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.\n\nThis vulnerability is only effective for files that have a file extension, which provides a partial mitigation. \n\n**Example request:**\n```http\nGET /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:foo\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is available for this vulnerability.\n\nIt is recommended that the package is only used for local development, and if the functionality is needed for production, a different package is used instead.", "methods": ["Used directory traversal to access files outside of the intended directory root.", "Used a malicious HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability.", "Exploited a vulnerability in a package used for local development."]}
