{"description": "### Impact\nUsers of the `requiresAuth` middleware, either directly or through the default `authRequired` option, are vulnerable to an Open Redirect when the middleware is applied to a catch all route.\n\nIf all routes under `example.com` are protected with the `requiresAuth` middleware, a visit to `http://example.com//google.com` will be redirected to `google.com` after login because the original url reported by the Express framework is not properly sanitised.\n\n### Am I affected?\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are using the `requiresAuth` middleware on a catch all route or the default `authRequired` option and `express-openid-connect` version `<=2.7.1`.\n\n### How to fix that?\nUpgrade to version `>=2.7.2`\n\n### Will this update impact my users?\nThe fix provided in the patch will not affect your users.\n", "methods": ["Uses URL redirection to an untrusted site.", "Uses a vulnerable middleware in a web application.", "Exploits a flaw in the Express framework's URL sanitization."]}
