{"description": "### Impact\n\n`ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1.\n\nThe contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue was patched in 4.7.1.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3552\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or need assistance deploying the fix, email us at [security@openzeppelin.com](mailto:security@openzeppelin.com).\n", "methods": ["Incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert.", "Incorrect implementation of EIP-165 in a target contract."]}
