{"description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39140](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39140.html).\n\n### Credits\nThe vulnerability was discovered and reported by Lai Han of nsfocus security team.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n", "methods": ["Manipulated input stream to cause a Denial of Service.", "Executed a payload to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system.", "Manipulated the processed input stream to cause a Denial of Service."]}
