{"description": "Our use of flate.NewReader does not limit the size of the input. The user could pass more than 1 MB of data in the HTTP request to the processing functions, which will be decompressed server-side using the Deflate algorithm. Therefore, after repeating the same request multiple times, it is possible to achieve a reliable crash since the operating system kills the process.\n", "methods": ["Used a Denial of Service (DoS) attack via Deflate Decompression Bomb.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the flate.NewReader function.", "Sent multiple HTTP requests to the processing functions.", "Attempted to cause a process crash by exceeding the input size limit."]}
