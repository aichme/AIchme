{"description": "### Impact\nInefficient regular expression complexity of `lowercase()` and `uppercase()` regex could lead to a denial of service attack. With a formed payload `'a' + 'a'.repeat(i) + 'A'`, only 32 characters payload could take 29443 ms time execution when testing `lowercase()`. The same issue happens with `uppercase()`.\n\n### Patches\nv1.5.1\n\n### References\n[huntr.dev report](https://huntr.dev/bounties/2d92f644-593b-43b4-bfd1-c8042ac60609)\n[_Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) and Catastrophic Backtracking_](https://snyk.io/blog/redos-and-catastrophic-backtracking/)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [v8n issues list](https://github.com/imbrn/v8n)\n* Email us at [brunodev02221@gmail.com](mailto:brunodev02221@gmail.com)\n", "methods": ["Used inefficient regular expression complexity to cause a denial of service attack.", "Exploited catastrophic backtracking in regular expressions."]}
