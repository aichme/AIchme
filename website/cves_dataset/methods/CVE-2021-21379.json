{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe `{{wikimacrocontent}}` executes the content with the rights of the wiki macro author instead of the caller of that wiki macro. This makes possible to inject scripts through it and they will be executed with the rights of the wiki macro (very often a user which has Programming rights).\n\nFortunately, no such macro exists by default in XWiki Standard but one could have been created or installed with an extension.\n\n### Patches\n\nIt has been patched in versions XWiki 12.6.3, 11.10.11 and 12.8-rc-1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no easy workaround other than disabling the affected macros.\nInserting content in a safe way or knowing what is the user who called the wiki macro is not easy.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-17759\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [our security mailing list](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Injects scripts through the {{wikimacrocontent}} macro, executed with the rights of the wiki macro author.", "Executes scripts with the rights of the author of a macro.", "Uses a macro to inject scripts and execute them with elevated privileges."]}
