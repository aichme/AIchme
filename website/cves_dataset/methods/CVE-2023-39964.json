{"description": "### Summary\nArbitrary file reads allow an attacker to read arbitrary important configuration files on the server.\n\n### Details\nIn the api/v1/file.go file, there is a function called LoadFromFile, which directly reads the file by obtaining the requested path parameter[path]. The request parameters are not filtered, resulting in a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability\n![picture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136411443/257109786-1b0af1e7-346f-4e92-9da2-d977f2f7fe6a.jpg)\n\n### PoC\nRequest /api/v1/files/loadfile, carry /etc/passwd data to read, as shown below:\n![\u5fae\u4fe1\u56fe\u7247_20230731112833](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/136411443/257109931-108fc16f-e180-4d1e-996c-d9da5f76559f.png)\n\n\n### Impact\n1Panel v1.4.3\n", "methods": ["Used a background arbitrary file reading vulnerability in the api/v1/file.go file.", "Read arbitrary important configuration files on the server.", "Used the LoadFromFile function to directly read files by obtaining the requested path parameter.", "Failed to filter request parameters, allowing arbitrary file reading.", "Used the /api/v1/files/loadfile endpoint to read files.", "Passed /etc/passwd data to read files."]}
