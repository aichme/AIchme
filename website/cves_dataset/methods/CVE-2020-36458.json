{"description": "lexer is a plugin based lexical reader.Affected versions of this crate implements Sync for ReaderResult<T, E> with the trait bound T: Send, E: Send. Since matching on the public enum ReaderResult<T, E> provides access to &T & &E, allowing data race to a non-Sync type T or E. This can result in a memory corruption when multiple threads concurrently access &T or &E. Suggested fix for the bug is change the trait bounds imposed on T & E to be T: Sync, E: Sync.", "methods": ["Data races in a plugin-based lexical reader can lead to memory corruption when multiple threads access non-Sync types.", "Data races can occur when accessing non-Sync types in a multi-threaded environment."]}
