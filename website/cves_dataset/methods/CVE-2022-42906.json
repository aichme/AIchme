{"description": "powerline-gitstatus (aka Powerline Gitstatus) before 1.3.2 allows arbitrary code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository configuration that changes the behavior of git, including running arbitrary commands. When using powerline-gitstatus, changing to a directory automatically runs git commands in order to display information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker can convince a user to change their current directory to one controlled by the attacker, such as in a shared filesystem or extracted archive, powerline-gitstatus will run arbitrary commands under the attacker's control. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2022-20001.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable application (Powerline Gitstatus) to execute arbitrary code.", "Manipulated the victim's environment to run arbitrary commands.", "Exploited a shared filesystem to execute malicious code.", "Used a Git repository to run arbitrary commands.", "Manipulated the victim's directory to execute malicious code."]}
