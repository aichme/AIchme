{"description": "The Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires a sandbox, as it by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2`, but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities  that may not have a fix, the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library.\n\n### Impact\n\nA malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by user input data.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNote that the [Backstage Threat Model](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/threat-model) states that scaffolder templates are considered to be a sensitive area that with the recommendation that you control access and perform manual reviews of changes to the scaffolder templates. The exploit is of a nature where it is easily discoverable in manual review.", "methods": ["Manipulated a templating library to allow for code injection.", "Used a vulnerable sandbox library (vm2) for code execution.", "Exploited a vulnerability in a template YAML definition for remote code execution.", "Manipulated a scaffolder template for remote code execution.", "Used write access to a registered scaffolder template for malicious purposes."]}
