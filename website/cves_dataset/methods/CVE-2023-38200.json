{"description": "### Impact\nKeylime `registrar` is prone to a simple denial of service attack in which an adversary opens a connection to the TLS port (by default, port `8891`) blocking further, legitimate connections. As long as the connection is open, the `registrar` is blocked and cannot serve any further clients (`agents` and `tenants`), which prevents normal operation. The problem does not affect the `verifier`.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to release 7.4.0", "methods": ["Used a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack to block legitimate connections to the Keylime `registrar`.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the Keylime `registrar` to gain control over the TLS port (8891)."]}
