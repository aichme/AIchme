Within the listener is code that requests a URL derived from the received message via fetch(). The URL is not validated or sanitised before it is fetched, thus allowing a malicious web page to arbitrarily fetch URL\u2019s via the victim's browser.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable extension to fetch arbitrary URLs.", "Failed to validate or sanitize user-controlled input.", "Leveraged a content script to execute malicious actions.", "Utilized a message listener to receive and act on malicious input."]}
