{"description": "### Impact\nUsing API or Controller based versions negative quantity is not adequately validated hence creating incorrect shopping cart and order total. \n\n### Patches\nAdding a back-end verification to check that quantity parameter isn't negative. If so, it is set to 1. Patched in 2.11.0\n\n### Workarounds\nWithout uprading, it's possible to just apply the fixes in the same files it's done for the patch. Or you use javax constraint validation on the quantity parameter.\n\n### References\n[Input Validation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n[Using bean validation constraint](https://javaee.github.io/tutorial/bean-validation002.html)\n[Commits with fixes](https://github.com/shopizer-ecommerce/shopizer/commit/929ca0839a80c6f4dad087e0259089908787ad2a)\nCVE Details below : \n[Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-11007)\n[NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11007)\n\n### Credits\nFound and solved by Yannick Gosset from Aix-Marseille University cybersecurity\nmaster program supervised by Yassine Ilmi", "methods": ["Used API or Controller based versions without adequate validation.", "Failed to check that quantity parameter isn't negative.", "Used javax constraint validation on the quantity parameter as a workaround.", "Added back-end verification to check quantity parameter in patch."]}
