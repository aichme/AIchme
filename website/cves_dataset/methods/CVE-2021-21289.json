{"description": "This security advisory has been created for public disclosure of a Command Injection vulnerability that was responsibly reported by @kyoshidajp (Katsuhiko YOSHIDA).\n\n### Impact\n\nMechanize `>= v2.0`, `< v2.7.7` allows for OS commands to be injected using several classes' methods which implicitly use Ruby's `Kernel.open` method. Exploitation is possible only if untrusted input is used as a local filename and passed to any of these calls:\n\n- `Mechanize::CookieJar#load`: since v2.0 (see 208e3ed)\n- `Mechanize::CookieJar#save_as`: since v2.0 (see 5b776a4)\n- `Mechanize#download`: since v2.2 (see dc91667)\n- `Mechanize::Download#save` and `#save!` since v2.1 (see 98b2f51, bd62ff0)\n- `Mechanize::File#save` and `#save_as`: since v2.1 (see 2bf7519)\n- `Mechanize::FileResponse#read_body`: since v2.0 (see 01039f5)\n\n\n### Patches\n\nThese vulnerabilities are patched in Mechanize v2.7.7.\n\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds are available. We recommend upgrading to v2.7.7 or later.\n\n\n### References\n\nSee https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/cops_security.html#securityopen for background on why `Kernel.open` should not be used with untrusted input.\n\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please open an issue in [sparklemotion/mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize/issues/new).", "methods": ["Used Command Injection to inject OS commands through Mechanize's methods.", "Used untrusted input to pass to Ruby's Kernel.open method.", "Used Mechanize's methods to download files from untrusted sources.", "Used Mechanize's methods to save files from untrusted sources."]}
