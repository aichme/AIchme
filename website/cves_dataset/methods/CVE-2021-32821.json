{"description": "MooTools is a collection of JavaScript utilities for JavaScript developers. All known versions include a CSS selector parser that is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). An attack requires that an attacker can inject a string into a CSS selector at runtime, which is quite common with e.g. jQuery CSS selectors. No patches are available for this issue.", "methods": ["Injects malicious strings into CSS selectors at runtime.", "Uses jQuery CSS selectors to inject malicious strings.", "Uses JavaScript utilities to inject malicious strings.", "Uses a vulnerable JavaScript library (MooTools) to inject malicious strings.", "Uses a vulnerable JavaScript library (MooTools) to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."]}
