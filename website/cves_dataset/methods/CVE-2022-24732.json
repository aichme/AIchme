{"description": "### Impact\n\nAny configuration on any maddy version <0.5.4 using auth.pam is affected.\n\nNo password expiry or account expiry checking is done when authenticating using PAM.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatch is available as part of the 0.5.4 release.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf /etc/shadow authentication is used, it is possible to replace auth.pam with auth.shadow which is not affected.\n\nIt is possible to blacklist expired accounts via existing filtering mechanisms (e.g. auth_map to invalid accounts in storage.imapsql).\n\n### References\n\n* https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy/blob/3412e59a2c92106e194fa69f2f1017c020037c9c/internal/auth/pam/pam.c\n* https://linux.die.net/man/3/pam_acct_mgmt\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy\n* Email fox.cpp@disroot.org\n", "methods": ["No exploitation of a vulnerability is mentioned in the description.", "No specific techniques are mentioned in the description.", "No C2 infrastructure is mentioned.", "No malicious files or payloads are mentioned.", "No system calls or API calls are mentioned.", "No persistence mechanisms are mentioned.", "No exploitation of a Key Past its Expiration Date and Insufficient Session Expiration in Maddy Mail Server is mentioned."]}
