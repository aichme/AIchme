{"description": "Jenkins Slack Notification Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.\n\nThis form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer (for global configuration) or Item/Configure permissions (for job configuration).", "methods": ["Used a missing permission check in a plugin to connect to an attacker-specified URL with attacker-specified credentials.", "Used a cross-site request forgery vulnerability to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.", "Used a form validation method without requiring POST requests."]}
