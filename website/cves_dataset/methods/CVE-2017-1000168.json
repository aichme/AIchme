{"description": "The scalarmult() function included in previous versions of this crate accepted all-zero public keys, for which the resulting Diffie-Hellman shared secret will always be zero regardless of the private key used.\n\nThis issue was fixed by checking for this class of keys and rejecting them if they are used.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the scalarmult() function to accept all-zero public keys.", "Leveraged a degenerate public key to obtain a predictable Diffie-Hellman shared secret."]}
