{"description": "CometVisu's file system endpoints don't require authentication and additionally the endpoint to update an existing file is susceptible to path traversal. This makes it possible for an attacker to overwrite existing files on the openHAB instance. If the overwritten file is a shell script that is executed at a later time this vulnerability can allow remote code execution by an attacker.\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's [Uncontrolled data used in path expression](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/java/java-path-injection/) query.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis issue may lead up to Remote Code Execution (RCE).", "methods": ["Used path traversal to overwrite existing files on the openHAB instance.", "Used unauthenticated file system endpoints.", "Used a shell script to execute malicious code.", "Achieved Remote Code Execution (RCE)."]}
