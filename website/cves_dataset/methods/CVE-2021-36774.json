The MySQL JDBC driver supports certain properties, which, if left unmitigated, can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code from a hacker-controlled malicious MySQL server within Kylin server processes. This issue affects Apache Kylin 2 version 2.6.6 and prior versions; Apache Kylin 3 version 3.1.2 and prior versions.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary code execution to execute code from a hacker-controlled server.", "Used a malicious MySQL server to execute code within Kylin server processes."]}
