{"description": "Quality Gates Plugin stores credentials in its global configuration file `quality.gates.jenkins.plugin.GlobalConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. While the credentials are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Quality Gates Plugin 2.5 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.", "methods": ["Stores credentials in plain text in a configuration file.", "Transmits credentials in plain text as part of a configuration form.", "Exposes credentials through browser extensions.", "Exposes credentials through cross-site scripting vulnerabilities."]}
