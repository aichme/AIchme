{"description": "By manipulating classpath asset file URLs, an attacker could guess the path to a known file in the classpath and have it downloaded. If the attacker found the file with the value of the tapestry.hmac-passphrase configuration symbol, most probably the webapp's AppModule class, the value of this symbol could be used to craft a Java deserialization attack, thus running malicious injected Java code. The vector would be the t:formdata parameter from the Form component.", "methods": ["Manipulated classpath asset file URLs to download a known file.", "Used a Java deserialization attack to run malicious injected Java code.", "Used the t:formdata parameter from the Form component as a vector.", "Exploited the tapestry.hmac-passphrase configuration symbol to obtain sensitive information."]}
