{"description": "### Impact\n\nA denial of services (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in Wrangler Git package affecting versions up to and including `v1.0.0`.\n\nSpecially crafted Git credentials can result in a denial of service (DoS) attack on an application that uses Wrangler due to the exhaustion of the available memory and CPU resources. This is caused by a lack of input validation of Git credentials before they are used, which may lead to a denial of service in some cases. This issue can be triggered when accessing both private and public Git repositories. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nA workaround is to sanitize input passed to the Git package to remove potential unsafe and ambiguous characters. Otherwise, the best course of action is to update to a patched Wrangler version.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include `v1.0.1` and later and the backported tags - `v0.7.4-security1`, `v0.8.5-security1` and `v0.8.11`.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) or [Wrangler](https://github.com/rancher/wrangler/issues/new) repository.\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).", "methods": ["None of the techniques mentioned in the description match the MITRE ATT&CK framework."]}
