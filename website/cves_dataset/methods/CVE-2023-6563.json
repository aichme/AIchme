{"description": "An unconstrained memory consumption vulnerability was discovered in Keycloak. It can be triggered in environments which have millions of offline tokens (> 500,000 users with each having at least 2 saved sessions). If an attacker creates two or more user sessions and then open the \"consents\" tab of the admin User Interface, the UI attempts to load a huge number of offline client sessions leading to excessive memory and CPU consumption which could potentially crash the entire system.", "methods": ["Consumes excessive system resources (memory and CPU) to potentially crash the system.", "Exploits a vulnerability in Keycloak to allocate resources without limits."]}
