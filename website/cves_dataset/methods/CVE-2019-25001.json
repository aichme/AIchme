{"description": "Affected versions of this crate did not properly check if semantic tags were nested excessively during deserialization. This allows an attacker to craft small (< 1 kB) CBOR documents that cause a stack overflow. The flaw was corrected by limiting the allowed number of nested tags.", "methods": ["Attempted to cause a stack overflow via out-of-bounds write in serde_cbor.", "Exploited excessive nested tags during deserialization."]}
