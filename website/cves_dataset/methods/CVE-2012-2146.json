{"description": "Elixir prior to and including 0.7.1 uses Blowfish in CFB mode without constructing a unique initialization vector (IV), which makes it easier for context-dependent users to obtain sensitive information and decrypt the database. A patch has been [attached](https://sochotni.fedorapeople.org/python-elixir-aes-encryption-addition.patch) to the initial advisory to mitigate this vulnerability.", "methods": ["Uses weak encryption (Blowfish in CFB mode without IV) to leak information.", "Leaks sensitive information due to weak crypto usage."]}
