{"description": "### Impact\n\nArbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution\n\n`node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. \n\n### Patches\n\n3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1\n\nNOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.\n\n```js\nconst path = require('path')\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  // either add this function...\n  onentry: (entry) => {\n    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n      entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)\n      entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)\n    }\n  },\n\n  // or this one\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.", "methods": ["Used insufficient absolute path sanitization in `node-tar` to create arbitrary files.", "Used insufficient absolute path sanitization in `node-tar` to overwrite arbitrary files.", "Used insufficient absolute path sanitization in `node-tar` to execute arbitrary code.", "Used custom `onentry` method to sanitize absolute paths in tar entries.", "Used custom `filter` method to remove tar entries with absolute paths."]}
