{"description": "Third-party blocks can be generated without transferring the whole token to the third-party authority. Instead, a `ThirdPartyBlock` request can be sent, providing only the necessary info to generate a third-party block and to sign it:\n\n- the public key of the previous block (used in the signature)\n- the public keys part of the token symbol table (for public key interning in datalog expressions)\n\nA third-part block request forged by a malicious user can trick the third-party authority into generating datalog trusting the wrong keypair.\n\nConsider the following example (nominal case)\n\n- Authority `A` emits the following token: `check if thirdparty(\"b\") trusting ${pubkeyB}`\n- The well-behaving holder then generates a third-party block request based on the token and sends it to third-party authority `B`\n- Third-party `B` generates the following third-party block `thirdparty(\"b\"); check if thirdparty(\"c\") trusting ${pubkeyC}`\n- The token holder now must obtain a third-party block from third party `C` to be able to use the token\n\nNow, with a malicious user:\n- Authority `A` emits the following token: `check if thirdparty(\"b\") trusting ${pubkeyB}`\n- The holder then attenuates the token with the following third party block `thirdparty(\"c\")`, signed with a keypair `pubkeyD, privkeyD)` they generate\n- The holder then generates a third-party block request based on this token, but alter the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` `publicKeys` field and replace `pubkeyD` with `pubkeyC`\n- Third-party `B` generates the following third-party block `thirdparty(\"b\"); check if thirdparty(\"c\") trusting ${pubkeyC}`\n- Due to the altered symbol table, the actual meaning of the block is `thirdparty(\"b\"); check if thirdparty(\"c\") trusting ${pubkeyD}`\n- The attacker can now use the token without obtaining a third-party block from `C`.\n\n### Impact\n\nTokens with third-party blocks containing `trusted` annotations generated through a third party block request\n", "methods": ["Manipulated third-party block requests to alter the public keys part of the token symbol table.", "Forged third-party blocks to trick the third-party authority into trusting the wrong keypair.", "Altered the `ThirdPartyBlockRequest` `publicKeys` field to replace a keypair with a different one.", "Used a malicious keypair to sign a third-party block.", "Attenuated a token with a third-party block to alter its meaning."]}
