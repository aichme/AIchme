{"description": "### Impact\nJsrsasign supports RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 (i.e. RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5) and RSA-OAEP encryption and decryption. Its encrypted message is represented as BigInteger. When there is a valid encrypted message, a crafted message with prepending zeros can be decrypted by this vulnerability.\n\n- If you don't use RSA PKCS1-v1_5 or RSA-OAEP decryption, this vulnerability is not affected.\n- Risk to forge contents of encrypted message is very low.\n- Risk to raise memory corruption is low since jsrsasign uses BigInteger class.\n\n### Patches\nUsers using RSA PKCS1-v1_5 or RSA-OAEP decryption should upgrade to 8.0.18.\n\n### Workarounds\nReject RSA PKCS1-v1_5 or RSA-OAEP encrypted message with unnecessary prepending zeros.\n\n### References\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14967\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14967\nhttps://vuldb.com/?id.157124\nhttps://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/api/symbols/KJUR.crypto.Cipher.html#.decrypt\nhttps://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/439\n\n\n\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in RSA PKCS#1 decryption to decrypt a crafted message with prepending zeros.", "Used a vulnerability in RSA PKCS#1 decryption to forge contents of an encrypted message.", "Used a vulnerability in RSA PKCS#1 decryption to raise memory corruption."]}
