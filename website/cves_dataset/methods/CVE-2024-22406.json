{"description": "### Impact\nThe Shopware application API contains a search functionality which enables users to search through information stored within their Shopware instance. The searches performed by this function can be aggregated using the parameters in the \u201caggregations\u201d\nobject. The \u2018name\u2019 field in this \u201caggregations\u201d object is vulnerable SQL-injection and can be exploited using time-based SQL-queries. \n\n### Patches\nUpdate to Shopware 6.5.7.4\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.", "methods": ["Used SQL injection to exploit a vulnerable API search function.", "Exploited a time-based SQL query vulnerability.", "Used the \"aggregations\" object to inject malicious SQL code.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the Shopware application API."]}
