{"description": "Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the `_strvals_` package that can cause an out of memory panic. Out of memory panics cannot be recovered from. Applications that use functions from the `_strvals_` package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `_strvals_` package contains a parser that turns strings into Go structures. For example, the Helm client has command line flags like `--set`, `--set-string`, and others that enable the user to pass in strings that are merged into the values. The `_strvals_` package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory panic.\n\nApplications that use the `_strvals_` package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.\n\nThe Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved in 3.9.4. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nSDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the `_strvals_` functions.\n\n### For more information\n\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.", "methods": ["Fuzz testing to identify input that causes an out of memory panic.", "Using user-supplied input to create large arrays causing significant memory usage.", "Parsing user-supplied input to create Go structures.", "Creating an out of memory panic that cannot be recovered from.", "Denial of Service through string value parsing."]}
