{"description": "### Impact\nWhen an application uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one for admin pages) and (2)  a session handler is set to `DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for admin pages).\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to version 4.2.11 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Use only one session cookie.\n\n### References\n- https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/sessions.html#session-drivers\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues)\n* Email us at [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/SECURITY.md)\n", "methods": ["Uses multiple session cookies to gain unauthorized access to restricted pages.", "Uses session handlers (DatabaseHandler, MemcachedHandler, RedisHandler) to bypass access controls.", "Uses session management to access pages that require another session cookie."]}
