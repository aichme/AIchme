{"description": "### Impact\nDue to use of unsafe YAML deserialization logic, an attacker with the ability to modify local YAML configuration files could provide malicious input, resulting in remote code execution or similar risks.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue can be patched by upgrading to v1.1.0 or later. It can also be patched by replacing YAML deserialization with equivalent safe_load calls.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/commit/507d066ef432ea27d3e201da08009872a2f37725\n- https://github.com/facebookresearch/ParlAI/commit/4374fa2aba383db6526ab36e939eb1cf8ef99879\n- https://anon-artist.github.io/blogs/blog3.html", "methods": ["Used deserialization of untrusted data to achieve remote code execution.", "Used unsafe YAML deserialization logic to inject malicious input."]}
