{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` uses a double indexing pattern:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_fill_empty_rows_op.cc#L263-L269\n\nIt is possible for `reverse_index_map(i)` to be an index outside of bounds of `grad_values`, thus resulting in a heap buffer overflow.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in 390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54 and will release a patch release for all affected versions.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap buffer overflow in Tensorflow implementation.", "Out-of-bounds read in `reverse_index_map(i)` function."]}
