{"description": "### Impact\n\nDuring a security audit of Helm's code base, Helm maintainers identified a bug in which a Helm plugin can contain duplicates of the same entry, with the last one always used. If a plugin is compromised, this lowers the level of access that an attacker needs to modify a plugin's install hooks, causing a local execution attack.\n\nTo perform this attack, an attacker must have write access to the git repository or plugin archive (.tgz) while being downloaded (which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection).\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in Helm 2.16.11 and Helm 3.3.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nMake sure to install plugins using a secure connection protocol like SSL.", "methods": ["Used a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection to modify a plugin's install hooks.", "Has write access to the git repository or plugin archive (.tgz) to modify a plugin's install hooks.", "Used a local execution attack to modify a plugin's install hooks."]}
