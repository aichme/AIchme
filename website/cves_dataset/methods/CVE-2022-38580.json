{"description": "### Impact\n\nSkipper prior to version v0.13.236 is vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF). An attacker can exploit a vulnerable version of proxy to access the internal metadata server or other unauthenticated URLs by adding an specific header (X-Skipper-Proxy) to the http request.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem was patched in version https://github.com/zalando/skipper/releases/tag/v0.13.237.\nUsers need to upgrade to skipper `>=v0.13.237`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUse `dropRequestHeader(\"X-Skipper-Proxy\")` filter\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/zalando/skipper/releases/tag/v0.13.237\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/zalando/skipper/issues/new/choose\n* Chat with us in slack: https://app.slack.com/client/T029RQSE6/C82Q5JNH5", "methods": ["Used SSRF to access internal metadata server or other unauthenticated URLs.", "Used HTTP request headers to exploit SSRF vulnerability (X-Skipper-Proxy).", "Used filter to prevent SSRF exploitation (dropRequestHeader(\"X-Skipper-Proxy\"))."]}
