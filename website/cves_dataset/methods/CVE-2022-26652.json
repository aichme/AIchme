{"description": "(This document is canonically: <https://advisories.nats.io/CVE/CVE-2022-26652.txt>)\n\n## Background\n\nNATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed communication technology, built for the cloud, on-premise, IoT, and edge computing.\n\nJetStream is the optional RAFT-based resilient persistent feature of NATS.\n\n\n## Problem Description\n\nThe JetStream streams can be backed up and restored via NATS. The backup format is a tar archive file.  Inadequate checks on the filenames within the archive file permit a so-called \"Zip Slip\" attack in the stream restore.\n\nNATS nats-server through 2022-03-09 (fixed in release 2.7.4) did not correctly sanitize elements of the archive file, thus a user of NATS\ncould cause the NATS server to write arbitrary content to an attacker-controlled filename.\n\n\n## Affected versions\n\nNATS Server:\n * 2.2.0 up to and including 2.7.3.\n   + Introduced with JetStream Restore functionality\n * Fixed with nats-io/nats-server: 2.7.4\n * Docker image:  nats <https://hub.docker.com/_/nats>\n * NB users of OS package files from our releases: a change in goreleaser defaults, discovered late in the release process, moved the install directory from /usr/local/bin to /usr/bin; we are evaluating the correct solution for subsequent releases, but not recutting this release.\n\nNATS Streaming Server\n * 0.15.0 up to and including 0.24.2\n * Fixed with nats-io/nats-streaming-server: 0.24.3\n * Embeds a nats-server, but this server is the old approach which JetStream replaces, so unlikely (but not impossible) to be\n   configured with JS support\n\n\n## Workarounds\n\n * Disable JetStream for untrusted users.\n * If only one NATS account uses JetStream, such that cross-user attacks are not an issue, and any user in that account with access to the JetStream API is fully trusted anyway, then appropriate sandboxing techniques will prevent exploit.\n   + Eg, with systemd, the supplied util/nats-server-hardened.service example configuration demonstrates that NATS runs fine as an unprivileged user under ProtectSystem=strict and PrivateTmp=true restrictions; by only opening a ReadWritePaths hole for the JetStream storage area, the impact of this vulnerability is limited.\n\n\n## Solution\n\nUpgrade the NATS server to at least 2.7.4.\n\nWe fully support the util/nats-server-hardened.service configuration for running a NATS server and encourage this approach.\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThis issue was reported (on 2022-03-07) to the NATS Maintainers by\nYiming Xiang, TIANJI LAB of NSFOCUS.  \nThank you / \u8c22\u8c22\u4f60\uff01\n", "methods": ["Used a \"Zip Slip\" attack to write arbitrary content to an attacker-controlled filename.", "Failed to sanitize elements of the archive file, allowing arbitrary file write."]}
