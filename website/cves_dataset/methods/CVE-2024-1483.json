{"description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in mlflow/mlflow version 2.9.2, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server. By crafting a series of HTTP POST requests with specially crafted 'artifact_location' and 'source' parameters, using a local URI with '#' instead of '?', an attacker can traverse the server's directory structure. The issue occurs due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the server's handlers.", "methods": ["Used path traversal to access arbitrary files on the server.", "Used HTTP POST requests with specially crafted parameters to traverse the server's directory structure.", "Failed to validate user-supplied input in server handlers."]}
