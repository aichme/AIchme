{"description": "### Impact\nAccepting the value of the `of` option of the [`.position()`](https://api.jqueryui.com/position/) util from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. For example, invoking the following code:\n```js\n$( \"#element\" ).position( {\n\tmy: \"left top\",\n\tat: \"right bottom\",\n\tof: \"<img onerror='doEvilThing()' src='/404' />\",\n\tcollision: \"none\"\n} );\n```\nwill call the `doEvilThing()` function.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to the `of` option is now treated as a CSS selector.\n\n### Workarounds\nA workaround is to not accept the value of the `of` option from untrusted sources.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, search for a relevant issue in [the jQuery UI repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues).
