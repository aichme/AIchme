{"description": "Jenkins openstack-heat Plugin 1.5 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system. A sequence of requests can be used to effectively list the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Bypassing security restrictions by exploiting a lack of permission checks in form validation.", "Lateral movement through a sequence of requests to list the file system.", "Discovery of file system information through a sequence of requests."]}
