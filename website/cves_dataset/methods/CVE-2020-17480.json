{"description": "### Impact\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in: the core parser, `paste` and `visualchars` plugins. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor via the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 4.9.6 or lower and TinyMCE 5.1.3 or lower.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 4.9.7 and 5.1.4 by improved parser logic and HTML sanitization.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe workarounds available are:\n- disable the impacted plugins\n- manually sanitize the content using the `BeforeSetContent` event (see below)\n- upgrade to either TinyMCE 4.9.7 or TinyMCE 5.1.4\n\n#### Example: Manually sanitize content\n```js\neditor.on('BeforeSetContent', function(e) {\n  var sanitizedContent = ...; // Manually sanitize content here\n  e.content = sanitizedContent;\n});\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\nTiny Technologies would like to thank Micha\u0142 Bentkowski for discovering this vulnerability.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes514/#securityfixes\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [TinyMCE repo](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues)\n* Email us at [infosec@tiny.cloud](mailto:infosec@tiny.cloud)\n", "methods": ["Used cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in TinyMCE.", "Executed arbitrary JavaScript code.", "Inserted specially crafted content into the editor via the clipboard or APIs.", "Impacted users of TinyMCE 4.9.6 or lower and TinyMCE 5.1.3 or lower.", "Patched in TinyMCE 4.9.7 and 5.1.4 with improved parser logic and HTML sanitization.", "Manually sanitized content using the `BeforeSetContent` event."]}
