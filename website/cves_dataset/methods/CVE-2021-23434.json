{"description": "This affects the package object-path before 0.11.6. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2020-15256 when the path components used in the path parameter are arrays. In particular, the condition `currentPath === '__proto__'` returns false if `currentPath` is `['__proto__']`. This is because the `===` operator returns always false when the type of the operands is different.", "methods": ["Used Prototype Pollution to bypass a vulnerability.", "Exploited a type confusion vulnerability in the package object-path.", "Manipulated the path parameter to execute malicious actions.", "Leveraged the condition `currentPath === '__proto__'` to achieve a bypass."]}
