Sites are only affected if the QuickEdit module (which comes with the Standard profile) is installed. Removing the \"access in-place editing\" permission from untrusted users will not fully mitigate the vulnerability.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in a web application (Drupal core).", "Used a module (QuickEdit) to gain unauthorized access.", "Failed to validate access to routes.", "Failed to properly validate user permissions.", "Used a module (QuickEdit) to enable in-place editing."]}
