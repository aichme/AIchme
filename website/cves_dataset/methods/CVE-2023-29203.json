{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible to list some users who are normally not viewable from subwiki by requesting users on a subwiki which allows only global users with `uorgsuggest.vm`. This issue only concerns hidden users from main wiki.\nNote that the disclosed information are the username and the first and last name of users, no other information is leaked. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.8, 14.4.3 and 14.7RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt's possible to workaround this vulnerability by patching directly `uorgsuggest.vm ` to apply the same changes as in https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/pull/1883.\n\n### References\n\n  * JIRA ticket: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20007\n  * this vulnerability is actually a remaining of https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-97jg-43c9-q6pf which wasn't entirely fixed back then\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["An attacker can list hidden users on subwikis through uorgsuggest.vm.", "An attacker can obtain information about hidden users on subwikis.", "An attacker can disclose usernames and first and last names of hidden users.", "Patching XWiki 13.10.8, 14.4.3, and 14.7RC1 fixes the issue.", "Patching uorgsuggest.vm directly is a workaround."]}
