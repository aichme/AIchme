{"description": "Weak JSON Web Token (JWT) signing secret generation in YMFE YApi through 1.9.2 allows recreation of other users' JWT tokens. This occurs because Math.random in Node.js is used as a source of randomness in jwt signing. Math.random does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers. This has been patched in version 1.9.3.", "methods": ["Used weak or compromised cryptographic key.", "Used insecure random number generation.", "Exploited a software vulnerability (CVE-2021-XXXX)."]}
