{"description": "### Impact\nIf [`MirrorPadGrad`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/mirror_pad_op.cc) is given outsize input `paddings`, TensorFlow will give a heap OOB error.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.MirrorPadGrad(input=[1],\n             paddings=[[0x77f00000,0xa000000]],\n             mode = 'REFLECT')\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [717ca98d8c3bba348ff62281fdf38dcb5ea1ec92](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/717ca98d8c3bba348ff62281fdf38dcb5ea1ec92).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Vul AI.\n", "methods": ["Heap out of bounds read in TensorFlow's MirrorPadGrad function.", "Execution of arbitrary code through a heap OOB error in TensorFlow.", "Use of GitHub commit to patch the vulnerability.", "Cherrypicking of patches for affected versions of TensorFlow.", "Use of a security guide for more information on the security model and contact information.", "Attribution of the vulnerability to Vul AI."]}
