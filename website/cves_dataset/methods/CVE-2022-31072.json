{"description": "### Impact\n\nVersions [4.23.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.23.0) and [4.24.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.24.0) of the octokit gem were published containing world-writeable files. \n\nSpecifically, the gem was packed with files having their permissions set to `-rw-rw-rw-` (i.e. 0666) instead of `rw-r--r--` (i.e. 0644). This means everyone who is not the owner (Group and Public) with access to the instance where this release had been installed could modify the world-writable files from this gem. \n\nMalicious code already present and running on your machine, separate from this package, could modify the gem\u2019s files and change its behavior during runtime.\n\n### Patches\n* [octokit 4.25.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.25.0)\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can use the previous version of the gem [v4.22.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/octokit/versions/4.22.0). Alternatively, users can modify the file permissions manually until they are able to upgrade to the latest version.\n\n", "methods": ["Published vulnerable software with world-writable files.", "Allowed malicious code to modify the software's files and change its behavior during runtime.", "Failed to properly set file permissions.", "Failed to validate file permissions.", "Used vulnerable software versions (4.23.0 and 4.24.0).", "Failed to patch vulnerable software (versions 4.23.0 and 4.24.0).", "Failed to use secure software versions (used 4.23.0 and 4.24.0 instead of 4.22.0 or 4.25.0)."]}
