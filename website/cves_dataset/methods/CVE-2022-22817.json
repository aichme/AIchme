{"description": "`PIL.ImageMath.eval` in Pillow before 9.0.0 allows evaluation of arbitrary expressions, such as ones that use the Python exec method `ImageMath.eval(\"exec(exit())\")`.\n\nWhile Pillow 9.0.0 restricted top-level builtins available to PIL.ImageMath.eval(), it did not prevent builtins available to lambda expressions. These are now also restricted in 9.0.1.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary expression injection in Pillow through `PIL.ImageMath.eval()`.", "Executed arbitrary code using the Python `exec` method.", "Used lambda expressions to bypass restrictions in Pillow 9.0.0."]}
