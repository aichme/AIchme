{"description": "The clone_from implementation for IdMap drops the values present in the map and then begins cloning values from the other map. If a .clone() call pancics, then the afformentioned dropped elements can be freed again.\nget_or_insert\n\nget_or_insert reserves space for a value, before calling the user provided insertion function f. If the function f panics then uninitialized or previously freed memory can be dropped.\nremove_set\n\nWhen removing a set of elements, ptr::drop_in_place is called on each of the element to be removed. If the Drop impl of one of these elements panics then the previously dropped elements can be dropped again.", "methods": ["Double-free vulnerability in the IdMap implementation.", "Uninitialized memory access due to get_or_insert function panic.", "Uninitialized memory access due to ptr::drop_in_place function panic.", "Double-free vulnerability when removing a set of elements."]}
