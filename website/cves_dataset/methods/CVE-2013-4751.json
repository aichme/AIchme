{"description": "When using the Validator component, if `Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Validator\\\\Mapping\\\\Cache\\\\ApcCache` is enabled (or any other cache implementing `Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Validator\\\\Mapping\\\\Cache\\\\CacheInterface`), some information is lost during serialization (the `collectionCascaded` and the `collectionCascadedDeeply` fields).\n\nAs a consequence, arrays or traversable objects stored in fields using the `@Valid` constraint are not traversed by the validator as soon as the validator configuration is loaded from the cache.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the Symfony Validator component to bypass security checks.", "Used a cache to store and load validator configuration, potentially allowing for information loss during serialization.", "Failed to traverse arrays or traversable objects stored in fields using the `@Valid` constraint."]}
