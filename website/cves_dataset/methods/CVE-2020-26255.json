{"description": "### Impact\n\nAn editor with full access to the Kirby Panel can upload a PHP `.phar` file and execute it on the server. This vulnerability is critical if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users, as they can gain access to the server with such a Phar file.\n\nVisitors without Panel access *cannot* use this attack vector.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in [Kirby 2.5.14](https://github.com/getkirby-v2/panel/releases/tag/2.5.14) and [Kirby 3.4.5](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.4.5). Please update to one of these or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/) to fix the vulnerability.\n\n**Note:** Kirby 2 reaches end of life on December 31, 2020. We therefore recommend to upgrade your Kirby 2 sites to Kirby 3. If you cannot upgrade, we still recommend to update to Kirby 2.5.14.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nKirby 2 sites on older releases can also be patched by applying the [changes from this commit](https://github.com/getkirby-v2/panel/commit/5a569d4e3ddaea2b6628d7ec1472a3e8bc410881).\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to Thore Imhof of Accenture for reporting the problem.", "methods": ["An attacker can upload a PHP Phar archive as a content file.", "An attacker with full access to the Kirby Panel can execute the Phar file on the server.", "The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated Panel users.", "The vulnerability is patched in Kirby 2.5.14 and 3.4.5.", "The vulnerability can be patched by applying the changes from the commit 5a569d4e3ddaea2b6628d7ec1472a3e8bc410881."]}
