{"description": "### Summary\n\nBy sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. Later this injection may lead to JS code execution by libraries that are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nConfigure WAF to drop requests containing next strings: `__proto__` , `constructor[prototype]`, `constructor.prototype`", "methods": ["Injected properties into JavaScript language construct prototypes.", "Executed JavaScript code through libraries vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.", "Used crafted requests to manipulate JavaScript prototypes.", "Utilized WAF evasion techniques to drop specific strings."]}
