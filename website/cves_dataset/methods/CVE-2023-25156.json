{"description": "### Impact\nPrevious versions of Kiwi TCMS do not impose rate limits which makes it easier to attempt brute-force attacks against the login page.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to v12.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers may install and configure a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS. For example nginx.\n\n### References\n[Disclosed by spyata](https://huntr.dev/bounties/2b1a9be9-45e9-490b-8de0-26a492e79795/)\n", "methods": ["No protection against brute-force attacks on login page.", "Used brute-force attacks against the login page.", "Installed a rate-limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS (e.g. nginx)."]}
