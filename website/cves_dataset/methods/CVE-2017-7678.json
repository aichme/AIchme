{"description": "In Apache Spark before 2.2.0, it is possible for an attacker to take advantage of a user's trust in the server to trick them into visiting a link that points to a shared Spark cluster and submits data including MHTML to the Spark master, or history server. This data, which could contain a script, would then be reflected back to the user and could be evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients. It is not an attack on Spark itself, but on the user, who may then execute the script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs.", "methods": ["Tricked users into visiting a link to a shared Spark cluster.", "Submits data including MHTML to the Spark master or history server.", "Data is reflected back to the user and evaluated and executed by MS Windows-based clients.", "User executes a script inadvertently when viewing elements of the Spark web UIs."]}
