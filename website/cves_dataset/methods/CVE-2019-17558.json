{"description": "Apache Solr 5.0.0 to Apache Solr 8.3.1 are vulnerable to a Remote Code Execution through the VelocityResponseWriter. A Velocity template can be provided through Velocity templates in a configset `velocity/` directory or as a parameter. A user defined configset could contain renderable, potentially malicious, templates. Parameter provided templates are disabled by default, but can be enabled by setting `params.resource.loader.enabled` by defining a response writer with that setting set to `true`. Defining a response writer requires configuration API access. Solr 8.4 removed the params resource loader entirely, and only enables the configset-provided template rendering when the configset is `trusted` (has been uploaded by an authenticated user).", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable web application (Apache Solr) to execute arbitrary code.", "Used a template injection technique to inject malicious code.", "Used a configuration API to define a response writer.", "Used a configset to render malicious templates.", "Used a parameter to enable template rendering.", "Used a trusted configset to enable template rendering."]}
