{"description": "Affected versions of `electron-packager` configure the generated application to disable SSL certificate verification by default. \n\nThis could allow an attacker with a privileged network position to launch a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack on the install process, intercepting the step where electron-packager downloads Electron for supported target platforms and architectures, and replacing the valid download with a tampered malicious one.\n\nThis only affects users using the electron-packager CLI. The strict-ssl option defaults to true for the node.js API.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\n1. Update to version 7.0.0 or later.\n2. Delete the `electron-download` cache folder, which is by default located at `~/.electron`.", "methods": ["Uses a Man In The Middle (MITM) attack to intercept and tamper with downloads.", "Uses a privileged network position to intercept the install process.", "Uses a tampered malicious download to compromise the install process."]}
