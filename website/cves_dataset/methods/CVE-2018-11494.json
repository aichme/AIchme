{"description": "The \"program extension upload\" feature in OpenCart through 3.0.2.0 has a six-step process (upload, install, unzip, move, xml, remove) that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code if the remove step is skipped, because the attacker can discover a secret temporary directory name (containing 10 random digits) via a directory traversal attack involving language_info['code'].", "methods": ["Used directory traversal to discover a secret temporary directory name.", "Executed arbitrary code via a six-step process involving upload, install, unzip, move, xml, and remove steps.", "Leveraged a directory traversal attack involving language_info['code'] to discover the secret temporary directory name."]}
