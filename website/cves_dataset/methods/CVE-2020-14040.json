{"description": "Go version v0.3.3 of the x/text package fixes a vulnerability in encoding/unicode that could lead to the UTF-16 decoder entering an infinite loop, causing the program to crash or run out of memory. An attacker could provide a single byte to a UTF16 decoder instantiated with UseBOM or ExpectBOM to trigger an infinite loop if the String function on the Decoder is called, or the Decoder is passed to golang.org/x/text/transform.String.\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\ngolang.org/x/text/encoding/unicode\ngolang.org/x/text/transform", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the golang.org/x/text package to cause an infinite loop in the UTF-16 decoder.", "Triggered an infinite loop by providing a single byte to a UTF16 decoder.", "Exploited the vulnerability to cause a program to crash or run out of memory."]}
