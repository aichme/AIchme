{"description": "### Impact \nThe [implementation of `SparseCountSparseOutput`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L168-L273) is vulnerable to a heap overflow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\ntf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(\n  indices=[[-1,-1]],\n  values=[2],\n  dense_shape=[1, 1],\n  weights=[1],\n  binary_output=True,\n  minlength=-1,\n  maxlength=-1,\n  name=None)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commits [2b7100d6cdff36aa21010a82269bc05a6d1cc74a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/2b7100d6cdff36aa21010a82269bc05a6d1cc74a) and [adbbabdb0d3abb3cdeac69e38a96de1d678b24b3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/adbbabdb0d3abb3cdeac69e38a96de1d678b24b3).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Faysal Hossain Shezan from University of Virginia.", "methods": ["Heap overflow in Tensorflow implementation.", "Used GitHub commits to patch the issue.", "Used GitHub to track the fix in TensorFlow 2.8.0 and other affected versions.", "Used a security guide for more information on the security model and contact information.", "Used a commit hash to identify the fix (2b7100d6cdff36aa21010a82269bc05a6d1cc74a).", "Used a commit hash to identify the fix (adbbabdb0d3abb3cdeac69e38a96de1d678b24b3)."]}
