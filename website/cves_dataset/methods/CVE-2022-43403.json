{"description": "A sandbox bypass vulnerability involving casting an array-like value to an array type in Jenkins Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier allows attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM. Script Security Plugin 1184.v85d16b_d851b_3 intercepts per-element casts when casting array-like values to array types.", "methods": ["Bypassed sandbox protection to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.", "Executed arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.", "Used a vulnerability in the Jenkins Script Security Plugin to execute arbitrary code."]}
