{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible to execute a Velocity script without script right through the document tree.\n\nTo reproduce:\n\n* As a user without script right, create a document, e.g., named Nasty Title\n* Set the document's title to `$request.requestURI`\n* Click \"Save & View\"\n* Reload the page in the browser\n\nThe navigation panel displays a document named with the current URL, showing that the Velocity code has been executed even though the user doesn't have script right.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.10.7 and 15.2RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA possible workaround is to:\n* modify the page XWiki.DocumentTreeMacros\n* search for the code `#set ($discard = $translatedDocument.setTitle($translatedDocument.title))`\n* modify it into `#set ($discard = $translatedDocument.setcomment(''))`\n\n### References\n\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20625\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/41d7dca2d30084966ca6a7ee537f39ee8354a7e3\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Executed Velocity script without script right through the document tree.", "Modified the page XWiki.DocumentTreeMacros to bypass security restrictions.", "Used the code `#set ($discard = $translatedDocument.setTitle($translatedDocument.title))` to execute malicious code.", "Modified the code to `#set ($discard = $translatedDocument.setcomment(''))` to prevent exploitation."]}
