{"description": "Jenkins Chef Sinatra Plugin 1.20 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins send an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled URL and have it parse the response as XML.\n\nAs the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nAdditionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.", "methods": ["Uses XXE to extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.", "Uses server-side request forgery (SSRF) to send HTTP requests to an attacker-controlled URL.", "Uses cross-site request forgery (CSRF) to perform unauthorized actions.", "Fails to perform permission checks in form validation."]}
