This will potentially affect all current users of `Paginator` prior to version >= 1.0.0.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in version 1.0.0 and all users should upgrade to this version immediately. Note that this patched version uses a dependency that requires an Elixir version >=1.5.\n\n### Credits\n\nThank you to Peter St\u00f6ckli.", "methods": ["Uses input parameters to the `paginate()` function for RCE attacks.", "Uses input parameters to the `paginate()` function for RCE attacks."]}
