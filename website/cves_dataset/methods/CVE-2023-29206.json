{"description": "### Impact\n\nThere was no check in the author of a JavaScript xobject or StyleSheet xobject added in a XWiki document, so until now it was possible for a user having only Edit Right to create such object and to craft a script allowing to perform some operations when executing by a user with appropriate rights. \n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.9-rc-1 by only executing the script if the author of it has Script right. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only known workaround consists in applying [the following patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/fe65bc35d5672dd2505b7ac4ec42aec57d500fbb) and rebuilding and redeploying `xwiki-platform-skin-skinx`.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira](http://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [Security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Exploited Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in JSX or SSX plugins.", "Created JavaScript objects in XWiki documents to craft malicious scripts.", "Executed scripts with user having appropriate rights.", "Patched by only executing scripts if author has Script right.", "Applied patch and rebuilt/redeployed `xwiki-platform-skin-skinx` as workaround."]}
