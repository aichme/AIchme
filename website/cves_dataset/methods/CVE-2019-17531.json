When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the service has the apache-log4j-extra (version 1.2.x) jar in the classpath, and an attacker can provide a JNDI service to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload.", "methods": ["Used JNDI to access a malicious payload.", "Executed a malicious payload via an externally exposed JSON endpoint.", "Leveraged a polymorphic typing issue in jackson-databind to execute a malicious payload."]}
