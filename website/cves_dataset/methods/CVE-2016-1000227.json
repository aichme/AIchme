{"description": "All versions of `bootstrap-tagsinput` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting when user input is passed into the `itemTitle` parameter unmodified, as the package fails to properly sanitize or encode user input for that parameter.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis package is not actively maintained, and has not seen an update since 2015. \n\nBecause of this, the simplest mitigation is to avoid using the `itemTitle` parameter. With over 200 open issues and over 100 open pull requests as of 2/2018, it seems unlikely that the author has any intention of maintaining the module. If avoiding the use of `itemTitle` indefinitely is acceptable, this is a workable solution. If not, the best available mitigation is to use a fork of the module that is actively maintained and provides similar functionality. There are [many such forks to choose from available on github.](https://github.com/bootstrap-tagsinput/bootstrap-tagsinput/network/members).", "methods": ["Used cross-site scripting (XSS) to inject malicious code.", "Failed to properly sanitize or encode user input for the `itemTitle` parameter."]}
