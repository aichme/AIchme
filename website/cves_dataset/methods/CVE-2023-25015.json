A CSRF attack works by getting an authorized user to visit a malicious website and then performing requests on behalf of the user. In this instance, actions include enabling and disabling jobs. All users running an affected release on Rails < 5.2 should upgrade immediately.\n", "methods": ["Uses a malicious website to trick an authorized user into performing actions on behalf of the user.", "Performs actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge or consent."]}
