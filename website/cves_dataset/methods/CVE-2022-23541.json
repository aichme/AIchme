{"description": "# Overview\n\nVersions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library can be misconfigured so that passing a poorly implemented key retrieval function (referring to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the [readme link](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback)) will result in incorrect verification of tokens. There is a possibility of using a different algorithm and key combination in verification  than the one that was used to sign the tokens. Specifically, tokens signed with an asymmetric public key could be verified with a symmetric HS256 algorithm. This can lead to successful validation of forged tokens. \n\n# Am I affected?\n\nYou will be affected if your application is supporting usage of both symmetric key and asymmetric key in jwt.verify() implementation with the same key retrieval function. \n\n# How do I fix it?\n \nUpdate to version 9.0.0.\n\n# Will the fix impact my users?\n\nThere is no impact for end users", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable library (jsonwebtoken) with a version <=8.5.1.", "Implemented a poorly configured key retrieval function in jwt.verify().", "Used a key retrieval function that allowed for incorrect verification of tokens.", "Used a key retrieval function that allowed for verification of tokens with a different algorithm and key combination than the one used to sign the tokens.", "Successfully validated forged tokens."]}
