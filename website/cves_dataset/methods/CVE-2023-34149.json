{"description": "Denial of service via out of memory (OOM) owing to not properly checking of list bounds. When a Multipart request has non-file normal form fields, Struts used to bring them into memory as Strings without checking their sizes. This could lead to OOM if developer has set struts.multipart.maxSize to a value equal or greater than the available memory.\n\nUpgrade to Struts 2.5.31 or 6.1.2.1 or greater.\n\n\n", "methods": ["Attempted to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via memory exhaustion.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Apache Struts.", "Failed to properly check list bounds."]}
