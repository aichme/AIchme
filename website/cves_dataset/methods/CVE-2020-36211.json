{"description": "In the affected versions of this crate, ImageChunkMut<'_, T> unconditionally implements Send and Sync, allowing to create data races.\n\nThis can result in a memory corruption or undefined behavior when non thread-safe types are moved and referenced across thread boundaries.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in commit e7fb2f5 by adding T: Send bound to the Send impl and adding T: Sync bound to the Sync impl.", "methods": ["Data races in gfwx crate can lead to memory corruption or undefined behavior when non-thread-safe types are moved and referenced across thread boundaries."]}
