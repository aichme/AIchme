{"description": "In Eclipse Theia versions 0.3.9 through 0.15.0, one of the default pre-packaged Theia extensions is \"Mini-Browser\", published as \"@theia/mini-browser\" on npmjs.com. This extension, for its own needs, exposes a HTTP endpoint that allows to read the content of files on the hosts filesystem, given their path, without restrictions on the requesters origin. This design is vulnerable to being exploited remotely through a DNS rebinding attack or a drive-by download of a carefully crafted exploit.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable extension in Eclipse Theia to read files on the host's filesystem.", "Exposed a HTTP endpoint to allow unauthenticated access to the filesystem.", "Used a DNS rebinding attack to exploit the vulnerability.", "Used a drive-by download to exploit the vulnerability."]}
