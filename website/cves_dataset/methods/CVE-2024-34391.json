{"description": "libxmljs is vulnerable to a type confusion vulnerability when parsing a specially crafted XML while invoking a function on the result of `attrs()` that was called on a parsed node. This vulnerability might lead to denial of service (on both 32-bit systems and 64-bit systems), data leak, infinite loop and remote code execution (on 32-bit systems with the XML_PARSE_HUGE flag enabled).", "methods": ["Attempted Denial of Service (DoS) via specially crafted XML.", "Data Leak via specially crafted XML.", "Attempted Remote Code Execution via specially crafted XML on 32-bit systems with XML_PARSE_HUGE flag enabled."]}
