{"description": "# Impact\nSean Wright from Secureworks has discovered an enumeration vulnerability. An attacker can make use of the Harbor API to make unauthenticated calls to the Harbor instance. Based on the HTTP status code in the response, an attacker is then able to work out which resources exist, and which do not. This would likely be accomplished by either providing a wordlist or enumerating through a sequence an\nunauthenticated attacker is able to enumerate resources on the system. This provides them with information such as existing projects, repositories, etc.\n\nThe vulnerability was immediately fixed by the Harbor team.  \n\n# Issue \nThe following API resources where found to be vulnerable to enumeration attacks:\n/api/chartrepo/{repo}/prov (POST)\n/api/chartrepo/{repo}/charts (GET, POST)\n/api/chartrepo/{repo}/charts/{name} (GET, DELETE)\n/api/chartrepo/{repo}/charts/{name}/{version} (GET, DELETE)\n/api/labels?name={name}&scope=p (GET)\n/api/repositories?project_id={id} (GET)\n/api/repositories/{repo_name}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE)\n/api/repositories/{repo_name}/tags (GET)\n/api/repositories/{repo_name}/tags/{tag}/manifest?version={version} (GET)\n/api/repositories/{repo_name/{tag}/labels (GET)\n/api/projects?project_name={name} (HEAD)\n/api/projects/{project_id}/summary (GET)\n/api/projects/{project_id}/logs (GET)\n/api/projects/{project_id} (GET, PUT, DELETE)\n/api/projects/{project_id}/metadatas (GET, POST)\n/api/projects/{project_id}/metadatas/{metadata_name} (GET, PUT)\n\n# Known Attack Vectors\nSuccessful exploitation of this issue will lead to bad actors identifying which resources exist in Harbor without requiring authentication for the Harbor API.\n\n# Patches\nIf your product uses the affected releases of Harbor, update to version 1.10.3 or 2.0.1 to patch this issue immediately.\n\nhttps://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/tag/v1.10.3\nhttps://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/tag/v2.0.1\n\n# Workarounds\nThere is no known workaround\n\n# For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, contact cncf-harbor-security@lists.cncf.io\nView our security policy at https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/security/policy", "methods": ["An attacker can make unauthenticated calls to the Harbor API to enumerate resources.", "An attacker can use the HTTP status code in the response to determine which resources exist and which do not.", "An attacker can use a wordlist or enumerate through a sequence to determine which resources exist.", "An attacker can enumerate existing projects, repositories, etc.", "An attacker can exploit the following API resources:"]}
