{"description": "A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in Apache Syncope prior to 2.1.6 enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Apache Syncope uses Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators. When building custom constraint violation error messages, they support different types of interpolation, including Java EL expressions. Therefore, if an attacker can inject arbitrary data in the error message template being passed, they will be able to run arbitrary Java code.", "methods": ["Injected arbitrary Java EL expressions in error message templates.", "Executed arbitrary Java code remotely without authentication.", "Used Server-Side Template Injection to inject malicious code.", "Used Java Bean Validation (JSR 380) custom constraint validators for code injection.", "Injected arbitrary data in error message templates to run malicious code."]}
