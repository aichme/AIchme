{"description": "### Impact\n\nImproper header parsing. An attacker could sneak in a newline (`\\n`) into both the header names and values. While the specification states that `\\r\\n\\r\\n` is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will also accept `\\n\\n`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is patched in 1.9.1 and 2.4.5.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds.\n\n### References\n\n* https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.2.4\n", "methods": ["An attacker could sneak in a newline (`\\n`) into both the header names and values.", "An attacker could exploit improper header parsing in guzzlehttp/psr7."]}
