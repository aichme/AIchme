{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible to execute anything with the right of the Scheduler Application sheet page.\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. As a user without script or programming rights, edit your user profile with the object editor and add a new object of type XWiki.SchedulerJobClass (search for \"Scheduler\")\n1. In \"Job Script\", add the following\n  ```{{/code}} {{async async=\"true\" cached=\"false\" context=\"doc.reference\"}}{{groovy}}println(\"Hello \" + \"from groovy!\"){{/groovy} {{/async}}```\n1. Click \"Save & View\"\n1. If the job information isn't already displayed (you should see \"Job Name\", \"Job Description\", etc.), append ?sheet=XWiki.SchedulerJobSheet to the URL.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.10.3 and 15.0 RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWhile the fix in the scheduler itself is easy, it relies on the code macro `source` parameter, which was introduced in 14.10.2 so you have to upgrade to benefit from it.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20295\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20462\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Code injection through XWiki.SchedulerJobClass.", "Execution of arbitrary code with the right of the Scheduler Application sheet page.", "Use of the \"groovy\" scripting language to execute code.", "Use of the \"async\" and \"cached\" parameters to execute code.", "Use of the \"source\" parameter in the code macro to execute code."]}
