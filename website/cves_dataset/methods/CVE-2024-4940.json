The vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to arbitrary websites, which can be exploited for phishing attacks, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), amongst others. This issue is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the handling of URLs. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that, when processed by the application, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled web page.", "methods": ["Used an open redirect vulnerability in gradio to redirect users to arbitrary websites.", "Exploited the vulnerability for phishing attacks, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)."]}
