{"description": "Jenkins allows administrators to choose the markup formatter to use for descriptions of jobs, builds, views, etc. displayed in Jenkins. When editing such a description, users can choose to have Jenkins render a formatted preview of the description they entered.\n\nJenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not implement any restrictions for the URL rendering the formatted preview of markup passed as a query parameter. This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability if the configured markup formatter does not prohibit unsafe elements (JavaScript) in markup, like [Anything Goes Formatter Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/anything-goes-formatter/).\n\nJenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 requires that preview URLs are accessed using POST and sets Content-Security-Policy headers that prevent execution of unsafe elements when the URL is accessed directly.\n\nIn case of problems with this change, these protections can be disabled by setting the [Java system properties](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/) `hudson.markup.MarkupFormatter.previewsAllowGET` to `true` and/or `hudson.markup.MarkupFormatter.previewsSetCSP` to `false`. Doing either is discouraged.", "methods": ["Used reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Jenkins markup formatter preview.", "Failed to implement restrictions for URL rendering of formatted preview of markup passed as a query parameter.", "Failed to set Content-Security-Policy headers to prevent execution of unsafe elements.", "Failed to restrict access to preview URLs to POST requests only.", "Failed to implement protections against XSS attacks in Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier."]}
