Delete the package\n2. Clear your npm cache\n3. Ensure it is not present in any other package.json files on your system\n4. Regenerate your SSH keys, registry credentials, tokens, and any other sensitive credentials that may have been present in your bash history.\n\nAdditionally, any service which may have been exposed via credentials in your bash history or accessible via your ssh keys, such as a database, should be reviewed for indicators of compromise as well.", "methods": ["Used a package manager (npm) to install malware.", "Sent sensitive data to attacker-controlled locations.", "Stole sensitive data (SSH key and bash history).", "Used credentials (registry credentials, tokens) for unauthorized access.", "Used credentials (SSH keys) for unauthorized access to services (database).", "Executed malicious code (stealing sensitive data).", "Created persistence by installing a malicious package."]}
