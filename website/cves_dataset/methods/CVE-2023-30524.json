Additionally, the configuration form does not mask these tokens, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.", "methods": ["Stores sensitive information in plain text in a configuration file.", "Allows unauthorized access to sensitive information through file system access.", "Exposes sensitive information in a configuration form."]}
