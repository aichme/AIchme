{"description": "qs before 6.10.3 allows attackers to cause a Node process hang because an `__ proto__` key can be used. In many typical web framework use cases, an unauthenticated remote attacker can place the attack payload in the query string of the URL that is used to visit the application, such as `a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000`. The fix was backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and 6.2.4.", "methods": ["Used Prototype Pollution to cause a Node process hang.", "Used a URL to deliver the attack payload.", "Used a query string to place the attack payload."]}
