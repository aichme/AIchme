{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible to display any page you cannot access through the combination of the async and display macro. \n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Enable comments for guests by giving guests comment rights\n2. As a guest, create a comment with content ```{{async}}{{display reference=\"Menu.WebHome\" /}}{{/async}}```\n3. Open the comments viewer from the menu (appends ?viewer=comments to the URL)\n\n-> the `Menu.WebHome` is displayed while the expectation would be to have an error that the current user is not allowed to see it\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.3, 14.4.8, and 13.10.11.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no known workaround.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20394\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XRENDERING-694\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Used the async and display macro to display restricted pages.", "Used the async and display macro to interact with any document in restricted mode.", "Created a comment with malicious content to exploit the vulnerability.", "Used the comments viewer to access restricted pages.", "Exploited the combination of the async and display macro to bypass access controls."]}
