Upgrade your dependency as follows:\n[`pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4`]\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not an option for you, a workaround can be to avoid using `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` in your applications.\n\n### References\n\n* [aiohttp @ PyPI]\n* [GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg]\n* [OWASP page on open redirects]\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [aiohttp repo](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at wk+aio-libs-security@sydorenko.org.ua and/or andrew.svetlov+aio-libs-security@gmail.com\n\nCredit: [Jelmer Vernoo\u0133] and [Beast Glatisant].\n\n[aiohttp @ PyPI]: https://pypi.org/p/aiohttp\n[`pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4`]: https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/3.7.4/\n[GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg]: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg\n[OWASP page on open redirects]:\nhttps://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html\n\n[Jelmer Vernoo\u0133]: https://jelmer.uk\n[Beast Glatisant]: https://github.com/g147", "methods": ["Used an open redirect vulnerability in aiohttp-based web-server.", "Used a maliciously crafted link to redirect the browser to a different website.", "Exploited a bug in the aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware middleware."]}
