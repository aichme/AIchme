{"description": "## Summary:\nA potential risk in clusternet which can be leveraged to make a cluster-level privilege escalation.\n## Detailed analysis:\nThe clusternet has a deployment called cluster-hub inside the clusternet-system Kubernetes namespace, which runs on worker nodes\nrandomly. The deployment has a service account called clusternet-hub, which has a cluster role called clusternet:hub via cluster role binding. The clusternet:hub cluster role has \"*\" verbs of \"*.*\" resources. Thus, if a malicious user can access the worker node which runs the clusternet, he/she can leverage the service account to do malicious actions to critical system resources. For example, he/she can leverage the service account to get ALL secrets in the entire cluster, resulting in cluster-level privilege escalation.", "methods": ["Used a service account with excessive privileges to access critical system resources.", "Leveraged a service account to access all secrets in the entire cluster.", "Achieved cluster-level privilege escalation."]}
