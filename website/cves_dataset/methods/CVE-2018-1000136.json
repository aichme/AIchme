{"description": "A vulnerability has been discovered which allows Node.js integration to be re-enabled in some Electron applications that disable it.\n\nFor the application to be impacted by this vulnerability it must meet all of these conditions\n\n- Runs on Electron 1.7, 1.8, or a 2.0.0-beta\n- Allows execution of arbitrary remote code\n- Disables Node.js integration\n- Does not explicitly declare webviewTag: false in its webPreferences\n- Does not enable the nativeWindowOption option\n- Does not intercept new-window events and manually override event.newGuest without using the supplied options tag\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to `electron` version 1.7.13, 1.8.4, or 2.0.0-beta.5 or later.\n\nIf you are unable to update your Electron version can mitigate the vulnerability with the following code.\n\n```js\napp.on('web-contents-created', (event, win) => {\n  win.on('new-window', (event, newURL, frameName, disposition,\n                        options, additionalFeatures) => {\n    if (!options.webPreferences) options.webPreferences = {};\n    options.webPreferences.nodeIntegration = false;\n    options.webPreferences.nodeIntegrationInWorker = false;\n    options.webPreferences.webviewTag = false;\n    delete options.webPreferences.preload;\n  })\n})\n\n// and *IF* you don't use WebViews at all,\n// you might also want\napp.on('web-contents-created', (event, win) => {\n  win.on('will-attach-webview', (event, webPreferences, params) => {\n    event.preventDefault();\n  })\n})\n```", "methods": ["Uses a vulnerability in Electron to execute arbitrary remote code.", "Uses a vulnerability in Electron to re-enable Node.js integration.", "Uses a vulnerability in Electron to bypass security features.", "Uses a vulnerability in Electron to execute code in a context where it should not be executed.", "Uses a vulnerability in Electron to execute code in a context where it should not be executed, specifically in a webview."]}
