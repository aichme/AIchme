This issue is patched in version 1.3.0, and users are recommended to upgrade.", "methods": ["Used deserialization to achieve Remote Code Execution.", "Used a database with write access to exploit the vulnerability.", "Used a JDBC EC with a MySQL data source to inject malicious parameters.", "Used a malicious JDBC URL to exploit the vulnerability."]}
