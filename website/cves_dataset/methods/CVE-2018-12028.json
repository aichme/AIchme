If the malicious application then generates an error, it would cause Passenger's process manager to kill said reported arbitrary PID.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in Phusion Passenger.", "Manipulated Passenger's process manager to kill an arbitrary process.", "Generated an error to trigger the process manager's action."]}
