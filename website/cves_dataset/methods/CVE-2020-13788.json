{"description": "# Impact\nMatt Hamilton from Soluble has discovered a limited Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) that allowed Harbor project owners to scan the TCP ports of hosts on the Harbor server's internal network. \n\nThe vulnerability was immediately fixed by the Harbor team.  \n\n# Issue \nThe \u201cTest Endpoint\u201d API, part of the functionality for ensuring a project Webhook is accessible and functional, is vulnerable to a limited SSRF attack. A malicious user that is also a project administrator can use this API for internal port scanning.\n\n# Known Attack Vectors\nSuccessful exploitation of this issue will lead to bad actors identifying open TCP ports on any network that is accessible by the Harbor core services\n\n# Patches\nIf your product uses the affected releases of Harbor, update to version 2.0.1 to patch this issue immediately.\n\nhttps://github.com/goharbor/harbor/releases/tag/v2.0.1\n\n# Workarounds\nSince only project administrators (the user that created the project) are allowed to test the webhook endpoints configured in Harbor, a Harbor system administrator can control who is a project admin. In addition, Harbor system administrators can enforce a setting where only an administrator is allowed to create new projects instead of the default Everyone. This further restricts who can be a project administrator in Harbor.\n\n# For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, contact cncf-harbor-security@lists.cncf.io\nView our security policy at https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/security/policy\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13788\nhttps://www.soluble.ai/blog/harbor-ssrf-cve-2020-13788", "methods": ["Used Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to scan internal network hosts.", "Exploited the \"Test Endpoint\" API for internal port scanning.", "Identified open TCP ports on internal networks accessible by Harbor core services."]}
