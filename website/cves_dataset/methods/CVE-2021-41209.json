{"description": "### Impact\nThe [implementations for convolution operators](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops.cc) trigger a division by 0 if passed empty filter tensor arguments.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f2c3931113eaafe9ef558faaddd48e00a6606235](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f2c3931113eaafe9ef558faaddd48e00a6606235).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Triggered division by 0 in convolution operators with zero size filters.", "Implemented a patch to fix the issue.", "Cherrypicked the patch for affected versions: TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4."]}
