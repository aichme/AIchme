{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe `?_trace=1` debugging feature in Datasette does not correctly escape generated HTML, resulting in a [reflected cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks) vulnerability.\n\nThis vulnerability is particularly relevant if your Datasette installation includes authenticated features using plugins such as [datasette-auth-passwords](https://datasette.io/plugins/datasette-auth-passwords) as an attacker could use the vulnerability to access protected data.\n\n### Patches\n\nDatasette 0.57 and 0.56.1 both include patches for this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you run Datasette behind a proxy you can workaround this issue by rejecting any incoming requests with `?_trace=` or `&_trace=` in their query string parameters.\n\n### References\n\n- [OWASP guide to reflected cross-site scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/#reflected-xss-attacks)\n- [Datasette issue #1360](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1360)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a discussion in [simonw/datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/discussions)\n* Email us at `swillison+datasette @ gmail.com`\n", "methods": ["Used reflected cross-site scripting to access protected data.", "Exploited a debugging feature in Datasette to inject malicious code.", "Used a proxy to reject incoming requests with specific query string parameters."]}
