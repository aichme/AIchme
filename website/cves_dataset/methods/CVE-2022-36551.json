Furthermore, self-registration is enabled by default in these versions of Label Studio enabling a remote attacker to create a new account and then exploit the SSRF. This issue is fixed in version 1.6.0.", "methods": ["Used SSRF to access arbitrary files on the system.", "Enabled self-registration to create a new account.", "Exploited SSRF to create a new account."]}
