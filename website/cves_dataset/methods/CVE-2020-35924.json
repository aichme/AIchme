{"description": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Sync trait for TryMutex<T> type. This allows users to put non-Send T type in TryMutex and send it to another thread, which can cause a data race. The flaw was corrected in the 0.3.0 release by adding T: Send bound for the Sync trait implementation.", "methods": ["Implemented a vulnerable implementation of the Sync trait for TryMutex<T> type, allowing non-Send T types to be sent between threads, potentially causing a data race.", "Failed to enforce the Send bound for the Sync trait implementation, allowing non-Send types to be used in a multi-threaded environment."]}
