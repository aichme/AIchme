{"description": "### Impact\nA potential timing attack exists on pages or documents that have been protected with a shared password through Wagtail's \"Privacy\" controls. This password check is performed through a character-by-character string comparison, and so an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this check to a high degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to gain knowledge of the password. (This is [understood to be feasible on a local network, but not on the public internet](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/django-developers/iAaq0pvHXuA/fpUuwjK3i2wJ).)\n\nPrivacy settings that restrict access to pages / documents on a per-user or per-group basis (as opposed to a shared password) are unaffected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.3 (for the LTS 2.7 branch), Wagtail 2.8.2 and Wagtail 2.9.\n\n### Workarounds\nSite owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can use [user- or group-based privacy restrictions](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/advanced_topics/privacy.html) to restrict access to sensitive information; these are unaffected by this vulnerability.", "methods": ["Uses timing attack to measure password length.", "Uses timing differences to gain knowledge of the password.", "Uses character-by-character string comparison.", "Uses local network for timing attack.", "Uses public internet for timing attack (not feasible).", "Uses user- or group-based privacy restrictions as a workaround.", "Uses Wagtail's \"Privacy\" controls for password check.", "Uses Wagtail versions 2.7.3, 2.8.2, and 2.9 as patched versions."]}
