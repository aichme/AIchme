{"description": "### Impact\n\nIn XWiki Platform, it's possible for a user to write a script in which any velocity content is executed with the right of any other document content author.\n\nTo reproduce:\n\nAs a user with script but not programming right, create a document with the following content:\n\n```\n{{velocity}}\n#set($main = $xwiki.getDocument('AppWithinMinutes.DynamicMessageTool'))\n$main.setTitle('$doc.getDocument().getContentAuthor()')\n$main.getPlainTitle()\n{{/velocity}}\n```\n\nSince this API require programming right and the user does not have it, the expected result is `$doc.document.authors.contentAuthor` (not executed script), unfortunately with the security vulnerability we get `XWiki.superadmin` which shows that the title was executed with the right of the unmodified document.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.10.7 and 15.2-RC-1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for it.\n\n### References\n\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20624\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/11a9170dfe63e59f4066db67f84dbfce4ed619c6\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20625\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/41d7dca2d30084966ca6a7ee537f39ee8354a7e3\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in XWiki Platform to escalate privileges from script right to programming right.", "Used a Velocity script to execute code with the rights of another document content author.", "Executed a script with the rights of the unmodified document, resulting in the title being set to \"XWiki.superadmin\"."]}
