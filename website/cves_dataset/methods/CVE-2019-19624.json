{"description": "An out-of-bounds read was discovered in OpenCV before 4.1.1 (OpenCV-Python before 4.1.0.25). Specifically, variable coarsest_scale is assumed to be greater than or equal to finest_scale within the calc()/ocl_calc() functions in dis_flow.cpp. However, this is not true when dealing with small images, leading to an out-of-bounds read of the heap-allocated arrays Ux and Uy.", "methods": ["Used an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in OpenCV.", "Executed code with incorrect assumptions about variable values.", "Accessed memory outside of allocated arrays Ux and Uy."]}
