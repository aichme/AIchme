{"description": "#### Impact\n\n`@keystone-6/core@2.2.0 || 2.3.0` users who are using the `multiselect` field, and provided field-level access control - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used.\n\nList-level access control is **NOT** affected.\n\nField-level access control for fields other than `multiselect` are **NOT** affected.\n\nExample, **you are vulnerable if** you are using field-level access control on a `multiselect` like the following:\n```ts\nconst yourList = list({\n  access: {\n    // this is list-level access control, this is NOT impacted\n  },\n  fields: {\n    yourFieldName: multiselect({\n      // this is field-level access control, for multiselect fields\n      //   this is vulnerable\n      access: {\n        create: ({ session }) => session?.data.isAdmin,\n        update: ({ session }) => session?.data.isAdmin,\n      },\n      options: [\n        { value: 'apples', label: 'Apples' },\n        { value: 'oranges', label: 'Oranges' },\n      ],\n      // ...\n    }),\n    // ...\n  },\n  // ...\n});\n```\n\n#### Mitigation\nPlease upgrade to `@keystone-6/core >= 2.3.1`, where this vulnerability has been closed.\n\n#### Workarounds\nIf for some reason you cannot upgrade your dependencies, you should stop using the `multiselect` field.\n\n#### Credits\nThanks to [Marek R](https://github.com/marekryb) for reporting and submitting the pull request to fix this problem.\n\nIf you have any questions around this security advisory, please don't hesitate to contact us at [security@keystonejs.com](mailto:security@keystonejs.com), or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/issues/new/choose).\n\nIf you have a security flaw to report for any software in this repository, please see our [SECURITY policy](https://github.com/keystonejs/keystone/blob/main/SECURITY.md).", "methods": ["Used field-level access control bypass for multiselect field.", "Exploited a vulnerability in `@keystone-6/core` version 2.2.0 or 2.3.0.", "Used a vulnerable version of `@keystone-6/core` to bypass access control."]}
