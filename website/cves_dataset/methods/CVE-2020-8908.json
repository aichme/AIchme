{"description": "A temp directory creation vulnerability exists in Guava prior to version 32.0.0 allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava `com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir()`. The permissions granted to the directory created default to the standard unix-like /tmp ones, leaving the files open. Maintainers recommend explicitly changing the permissions after the creation of the directory, or removing uses of the vulnerable method.\n", "methods": ["Created a temporary directory with default permissions.", "Failed to properly secure temporary files."]}
