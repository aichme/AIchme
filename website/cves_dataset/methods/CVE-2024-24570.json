{"description": "### Impact\n\nHTML files crafted to look like jpg files are able to be uploaded, allowing for XSS.\n\nThis affects:\n\n- front-end forms with asset fields without any mime type validation\n- asset fields in the control panel\n- asset browser in the control panel\n\nAdditionally, if the XSS is crafted in a specific way, the \"copy password reset link\" feature may be exploited to gain access to a user's password reset token and gain access to their account. The authorized user is required to execute the XSS in order for the vulnerability to occur.\n\n### Patches\n\nIn versions 4.46.0 and 3.4.17, the XSS vulnerability has been patched, and the copy password reset link functionality has been disabled. (Users may still trigger password reset emails.)\n\n### Credits\n\nStatamic thanks Niklas Schilling (discovery, analysis, coordination) from the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab (https://www.sec-consult.com/) for responsibly reporting the identified issues and working with us as we addressed them.", "methods": ["Used XSS to gain access to user accounts.", "Exploited password reset link to gain access to user accounts.", "Uploaded malicious HTML files disguised as JPG files.", "Used front-end forms without mime type validation.", "Exploited asset fields in the control panel.", "Exploited asset browser in the control panel.", "Used a vulnerability in Statmic CMS to gain unauthorized access."]}
