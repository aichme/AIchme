{"description": "Versions of `set-value` prior to 3.0.1 or 2.0.1 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The `set` function fails to validate which Object properties it updates. This allows attackers to modify the prototype of Object, causing the addition or modification of an existing property on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf you are using `set-value` 3.x, upgrade to version 3.0.1 or later.\nIf you are using `set-value` 2.x, upgrade to version 2.0.1 or later.", "methods": ["Used Prototype Pollution to modify the prototype of Object.", "Added or modified an existing property on all objects.", "Failed to validate which Object properties to update.", "Updated the prototype of Object without proper validation."]}
