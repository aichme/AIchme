{"description": "### Impact\nAll rights checks that would normally prevent a user from viewing a document on a wiki can be bypassed using the login action and directly specified templates. This exposes title, content and comments of any document and properties of objects (class and property name must be known, though). This is also exploitable on [private wikis](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/#HPrivateWiki).\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in versions 14.2 and 13.10.4 by properly checking view rights before loading documents and disallowing non-default templates in the login, registration and skin action.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt would be possible to protect all templates individually by adding code to check access rights first, but due to the number of templates and the fact that some of them need to be used without view rights, this seems impractical.\n\n### References\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19549\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18602\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [security mailing-list](mailto:security@xwiki.com)\n", "methods": ["Bypasses all rights checks to view documents and properties of objects.", "Exposes title, content, and comments of any document and properties of objects.", "Exploitable on private wikis.", "Can be patched by properly checking view rights before loading documents and disallowing non-default templates in the login, registration, and skin action.", "Can be mitigated by protecting all templates individually by adding code to check access rights first."]}
