{"description": "### Problem\nPassword hashes were being reflected in the editing forms of the TYPO3 backend user interface. This allowed attackers to crack the plaintext password using brute force techniques. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to the TYPO3 framework merger Christian Kuhn and external security researchers Maximilian Beckmann, Klaus-G\u00fcnther Schmidt who reported this issue, and TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2024-003](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2024-003)\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable application (TYPO3 Backend Forms) to obtain hashed passwords.", "Used brute force techniques to crack plaintext passwords.", "Exploited a valid backend user account to access the vulnerable application."]}
