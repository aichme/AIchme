{"description": "xUnit Plugin 3.0.8 and earlier implements an agent-to-controller message that creates a user-specified directory if it doesn\u2019t exist, and parsing files inside it as test results.\n\nThis allows attackers able to control agent processes to create an arbitrary directory on the Jenkins controller or to obtain test results from existing files in an attacker-specified directory.\n\nxUnit Plugin 3.1.0 changes the message type from agent-to-controller to controller-to-agent, preventing execution on the controller.", "methods": ["Created an arbitrary directory on the Jenkins controller.", "Obtained test results from an attacker-specified directory.", "Executed code on the Jenkins controller."]}
