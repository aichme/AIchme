{"description": "A vulnerability exists in CakePHP versions 4.0.x through 4.1.3. The CsrfProtectionMiddleware component allows method override parameters to bypass CSRF checks by changing the HTTP request method to an arbitrary string that is not in the list of request methods that CakePHP checks. Additionally, the route middleware does not verify that this overriden method (which can be an arbitrary string) is actually an HTTP method.", "methods": ["Bypasses security controls (CSRF checks).", "Manipulates HTTP requests (changes HTTP request method to an arbitrary string).", "Manipulates application behavior (route middleware does not verify overridden method)."]}
