{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can craft a TFLite model that would trigger a division by zero error in LSH  [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea80df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/lsh_projection.cc#L118).\n\n```cc\nint RunningSignBit(const TfLiteTensor* input, const TfLiteTensor* weight,\n                   float seed) {\n  int input_item_bytes = input->bytes / SizeOfDimension(input, 0);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n          \nThere is no check that the first dimension of the input is non zero.\n      \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [0575b640091680cfb70f4dd93e70658de43b94f9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0575b640091680cfb70f4dd93e70658de43b94f9).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick thiscommit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for  more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security.", "methods": ["Crafted a TFLite model to trigger a division by zero error in LSH implementation.", "Failed to check the first dimension of the input is non-zero."]}
