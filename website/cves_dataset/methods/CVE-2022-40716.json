{"description": "HashiCorp Consul and Consul Enterprise versions prior to 1.11.9, 1.12.5, and 1.13.2 do not check for multiple SAN URI values in a CSR on the internal RPC endpoint, enabling leverage of privileged access to bypass service mesh intentions. A specially crafted CSR sent directly to Consul\u2019s internal server agent RPC endpoint can include multiple SAN URI values with additional service names. This issue has been fixed in versions 1.11.9, 1.12.5, and 1.13.2. There are no known workarounds.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in HashiCorp Consul to bypass authorization.", "Sent a specially crafted CSR to the internal RPC endpoint.", "Leveraged privileged access to Consul's service mesh intentions."]}
