{"description": "### Impact\n\nOWSLib's XML parser (which supports both `lxml` and `xml.etree`) does not disable entity resolution for `lxml`, and could lead to arbitrary file reads from an attacker-controlled XML payload. This affects all XML parsing in the codebase.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Use only lxml for XML handling, adding `resolve_entities=False` to `lxml`'s parser: https://github.com/geopython/OWSLib/pull/863\n\n### Workarounds\n\n```python\npatch_well_known_namespaces(etree)\netree.set_default_parser(\n    parser=etree.XMLParser(resolve_entities=False)\n)\n```\n\n### References\n\n- [`GHSL-2022-131`](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-131_OWSLib/)\n", "methods": ["Used XML External Entity (XXE) Injection to read arbitrary files.", "Used XML parsing to inject malicious XML payload."]}
