{"description": "Copy Artifact Plugin 1.43.1 and earlier performs improper permission checks when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project build. This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to access.\n\nCopy Artifact Plugin 1.44 now properly performs permission checks when copying artifacts. When updating the plugin from a previous version, the previous behavior is retained (\\\"Migration mode\\\"). To enable the additional protections, switch to the new \\\"Production mode\\\". Doing so may cause existing jobs to fail to copy artifacts. For more information see the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin).", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in Jenkins Copy Artifact Plugin to gain unauthorized access to artifacts.", "Used elevated privileges to configure jobs.", "Leveraged Job/Configure permission to bypass access controls.", "Exploited improper permission checks to access restricted resources."]}
