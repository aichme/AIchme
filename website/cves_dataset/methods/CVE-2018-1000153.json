Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability. As of version 2.17, these form validation methods require POST requests and appropriate user permissions.", "methods": ["Used a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Jenkins vSphere Plugin to send requests to the configured vSphere server.", "Sent credentials stored in Jenkins to an attacker-specified server.", "Used form validation methods to send numerous requests to the vSphere server, potentially resulting in denial of service."]}
