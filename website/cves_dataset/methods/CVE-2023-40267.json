{"description": "GitPython before 3.1.32 does not block insecure non-multi options in `clone` and `clone_from`, making it vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper user input validation, which makes it possible to inject a maliciously crafted remote URL into the clone command. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible because the library makes external calls to git without sufficient sanitization of input arguments. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-24439.", "methods": ["Injects maliciously crafted remote URLs into the clone command.", "Makes external calls to git without sufficient sanitization of input arguments.", "Fails to block insecure non-multi options in `clone` and `clone_from`."]}
