{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe Matrix specification specifies a list of [event authorization rules](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.3/rooms/v10/#authorization-rules) which must be checked when determining if an event should be accepted into a room.\n\nIn versions of Synapse up to and including v1.61, some of these rules are not correctly applied. An attacker could craft events which would be accepted by Synapse but not a spec-conformant server, potentially causing divergence in the room state between servers.\n\n### Patches\n\nAdministrators of homeservers with federation enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.62.0 or higher.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n * Federation can be disabled by setting [`federation_domain_whitelist`](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#federation_domain_whitelist) to an empty list (`[]`).\n\n### References\n\n * https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13087\n * https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13088\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).", "methods": ["Incorrect application of event authorization rules.", "Crafted events to be accepted by Synapse but not a spec-conformant server.", "Divergence in the room state between servers.", "Federation can be disabled by setting `federation_domain_whitelist` to an empty list (`[]`)."]}
