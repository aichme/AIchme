A malformed MKV file could cause the file type detector to get caught in an infinite loop. This would make the application become unresponsive and could be used to cause a DoS attack when used on a web server.", "methods": ["Used a malformed MKV file to cause an infinite loop.", "Attempted to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on a web server."]}
