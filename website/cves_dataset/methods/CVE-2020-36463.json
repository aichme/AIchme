{"description": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Send for types used in queue implementations (InnerSend<RW, T>, InnerRecv<RW, T>, FutInnerSend<RW, T>, FutInnerRecv<RW, T>). This allows users to send non-Send types to other threads, which can lead to data race bugs or other undefined behavior.", "methods": ["Implemented Send for non-Send types in queue implementations.", "Allows sending non-Send types to other threads.", "Can lead to data race bugs or undefined behavior."]}
