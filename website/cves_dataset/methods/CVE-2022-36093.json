{"description": "### Impact\nBy passing a template of the distribution wizard to the xpart template, user accounts can be created even when user registration is disabled. This also circumvents any email verification. Before versions 14.2 and 13.10.4, this can also be exploited on a private wiki, thus potentially giving the attacker access to the wiki. Depending on the configured default rights of users, this could also give attackers write access to an otherwise read-only public wiki. Users can also be created when an external authentication system like LDAP is configured, but authentication fails unless the authentication system supports a bypass/local accounts are enabled in addition to the external authentication system.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in XWiki 13.10.5 and 14.3RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is possible to replace `xpart.vm`, the entry point for this attack, by a patched version from the [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/70c64c23f4404f33289458df2a08f7c4be022755) without updating XWiki.\n\n### References\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19558\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Created unauthorized user accounts through the distribution wizard.", "Bypassed email verification.", "Exploited private wiki vulnerability to gain access.", "Gained write access to a read-only public wiki.", "Created user accounts when external authentication system failed.", "Used a bypass/local accounts in addition to external authentication system.", "Replaced a vulnerable file (`xpart.vm`) with a patched version."]}
