{"description": "Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the `_chartutil_` package that can cause a segmentation violation. Applications that use functions from the `_chartutil_` package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `_chartutil_` package contains a parser that loads a JSON Schema validation file. For example, the Helm client when rendering a chart will validate its values with the schema file. The `_chartutil_` package parses the schema file and loads it into structures Go can work with. Some schema files can cause array data structures to be created causing a memory violation.\n\nApplications that use the `_chartutil_` package in the Helm SDK to parse a schema file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.\n\nThe Helm Client will panic with a schema file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been resolved in 3.10.3. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nSDK users can validate schema files that are correctly formatted before passing them to the `_chartutil_` functions.\n\n### For more information\n\nHelm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.", "methods": ["Fuzz testing to identify input that can cause a segmentation violation.", "Parsing of malicious JSON Schema validation files to cause a memory violation.", "Use of a Denial of Service attack to cause a panic in the Helm client."]}
