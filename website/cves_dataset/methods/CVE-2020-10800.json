{"description": "All versions of `lix` are vulnerable to Machine-In-The-Middle. The package accepts downloads with `http` and follows `location` header redirects for package downloads.

Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.", "methods": ["Intercepted a package installation to redirect the download to a malicious source.", "Used a privileged network position to intercept a package installation."]}
