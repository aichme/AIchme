{"description": "Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts.\n\nZAP Pipeline Plugin prior to 1.10 globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.\n\nJenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#resource-domain-support) configured are largely unaffected. A possible exception are file parameter downloads. The behavior of those depends on the specific version of Jenkins:\n- Jenkins 2.231 and newer, including 2.235.x LTS, is unaffected, as all resource files from user content are generally served safely from a different domain, without restrictions from `Content-Security-Policy` header.\n- Jenkins between 2.228 (inclusive) and 2.230 (inclusive), as well as all releases of Jenkins 2.222.x LTS and the 2.204.6 LTS release, are affected by this vulnerability, as file parameters are not served via the Resource Root URL.\n- Jenkins 2.227 and older, 2.204.5 and older, don\u2019t have XSS protection for file parameter values, see [SECURITY-1793](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-03-25/#SECURITY-1793).", "methods": ["Disables Content-Security-Policy protection for static files served by Jenkins.", "Allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with control over files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.", "Vulnerable in Jenkins 2.228 to 2.230, 2.222.x LTS, and 2.204.6 LTS.", "Vulnerable in Jenkins 2.227 and older, 2.204.5 and older."]}
