If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the `mac_address_for` function of the package, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the operating system that this package is being run on.", "methods": ["Used input sanitization bypass techniques.", "Executed arbitrary commands on the operating system.", "Leveraged the `child_process` exec function.", "Used user input to execute commands."]}
