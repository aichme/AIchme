{"description": "Pivotal Spring Framework before 6.0.0 suffers from a potential remote code execution (RCE) issue if used for Java deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on how the library is implemented within a product, this issue may or not occur, and authentication may be required.\n\nMaintainers recommend investigating alternative components or a potential mitigating control. Version 4.2.6 and 3.2.17 contain [enhanced documentation](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/5cbe90b2cd91b866a5a9586e460f311860e11cfa) advising users to take precautions against unsafe Java deserialization, version 5.3.0 [deprecate the impacted classes](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/25379) and version 6.0.0 [removed it entirely](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/27422).", "methods": ["Uses Java deserialization of untrusted data to achieve RCE.", "Uses vulnerable library (Pivotal Spring Framework) to execute code.", "Uses authentication to bypass mitigations.", "Uses alternative components to maintain persistence.", "Uses deprecated classes to maintain functionality.", "Uses deprecated classes to maintain functionality.", "Removes vulnerable code to prevent exploitation."]}
