{"description": "All versions of `ini-parser` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The `parse` function does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype, which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all objects.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.", "methods": ["Used prototype pollution to modify an Object's prototype.", "Added or modified an existing property on all objects.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the `parse` function of `ini-parser`."]}
