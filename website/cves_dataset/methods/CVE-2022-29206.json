{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of [`tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorDenseAdd`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f3b9bf4c3c0597563b289c0512e98d4ce81f886e/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_tensor_dense_add_op.cc) does not fully validate the input arguments:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\na_indices = tf.constant(0, shape=[17, 2], dtype=tf.int64)\na_values = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32)\na_shape = tf.constant([6, 12], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int64)\n\nb = tf.constant(-0.223668531, shape=[6, 12], dtype=tf.float32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.SparseTensorDenseAdd(\n    a_indices=a_indices, a_values=a_values, a_shape=a_shape, b=b)\n```\n\nIn this case, a reference gets bound to a `nullptr` during kernel execution. This is UB.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [11ced8467eccad9c7cb94867708be8fa5c66c730](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/11ced8467eccad9c7cb94867708be8fa5c66c730).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou from Secure Systems Lab at Brown University.", "methods": ["Missing validation results in undefined behavior in `SparseTensorDenseAdd` implementation.", "Reference gets bound to a `nullptr` during kernel execution."]}
