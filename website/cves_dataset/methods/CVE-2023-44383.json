{"description": "### Impact\n\nA user with access to the media manager that stores SVG files could create a stored XSS attack against themselves and any other user with access to the media manager when SVG files are supported.\n\nSVG files are supported by default in v3 for convenience; however, this has resulted in multiple mistaken vulnerability reports from security researchers. As per the documentation, if a backend user is not trusted, the advice is to remove the `svg` extension from the list of supported file types.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in v3.5.2 by including an SVG sanister. It is enabled by default for new installations but must be enabled for existing sites in the **config/media.php** file.\n\n```\n'clean_vectors' => true,\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade for this patch, follow the pervious advice and remove `svg` from the supported file types.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/octobercms/october/blob/3.x/config/media.php\n\nCredits to:\n- Faris Krivic\n- Okan Kurtulus\n- Aldin Visnjic\n- Bug Shankar\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)\n", "methods": ["Stored XSS attack against authenticated backend user.", "Improper configuration of file types supported by the media manager.", "Use of SVG files for malicious purposes.", "Removal of SVG extension from supported file types as a workaround.", "Enabling SVG sanitizer in config/media.php file as a patch."]}
