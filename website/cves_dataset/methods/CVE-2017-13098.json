{"description": "BouncyCastle TLS prior to version 1.0.3, when configured to use the JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) for cryptographic functions, provides a weak Bleichenbacher oracle when any TLS cipher suite using RSA key exchange is negotiated. An attacker can recover the private key from a vulnerable application. This vulnerability is referred to as \"ROBOT.\"", "methods": ["Uses a weak cryptographic function (Bleichenbacher oracle) in BouncyCastle TLS.", "Exploits a vulnerability in a cryptographic library (JCE) to recover a private key."]}
