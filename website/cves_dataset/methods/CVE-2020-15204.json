{"description": "### Impact\nIn eager mode, TensorFlow does not set the session state. Hence, calling `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionHandle` or `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionHandleV2` results in a null pointer dereference:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/session_ops.cc#L45\n\nIn the above snippet, in eager mode, `ctx->session_state()` returns `nullptr`. Since code immediately dereferences this, we get a segmentation fault.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in 9a133d73ae4b4664d22bd1aa6d654fec13c52ee1 and will release patch releases for all versions between 1.15 and 2.3.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["A null pointer dereference occurs when calling `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionHandle` or `tf.raw_ops.GetSessionHandleV2` in eager mode.", "A segmentation fault is triggered due to the null pointer dereference."]}
