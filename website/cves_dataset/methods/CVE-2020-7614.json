{"description": "All versions of `npm-programmatic ` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input rules and passes it directly to an `exec` call on the `install`, `uninstall` and `list` functions . This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system if the package name passed to the function is user-controlled.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.", "methods": ["Command Injection via unsanitized input rules passed to an `exec` call.", "Execution of arbitrary code in the system."]}
