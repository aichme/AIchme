{"description": "### Impact\nIncomplete validation in `SparseReshape` results in a denial of service based on a `CHECK`-failure.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput_indices = tf.constant(41, shape=[1, 1], dtype=tf.int64)\ninput_shape = tf.zeros([11], dtype=tf.int64)\nnew_shape = tf.zeros([1], dtype=tf.int64)\n\ntf.raw_ops.SparseReshape(input_indices=input_indices,\n    input_shape=input_shape,\n    new_shape=new_shape)\n``` \n    \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e87b51ce05c3eb172065a6ea5f48415854223285/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_reshape_op.cc#L40) has no validation that the input arguments specify a valid sparse tensor.\n\n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1d04d7d93f4ed3854abf75d6b712d72c3f70d6b6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1d04d7d93f4ed3854abf75d6b712d72c3f70d6b6).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are the only affected versions.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution \nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["No exploitation techniques are mentioned in the description.", "No C2 infrastructure is mentioned.", "No email or document attachments are mentioned.", "No PowerShell commands are mentioned.", "No direct Windows system calls are mentioned.", "No malicious DLLs are mentioned.", "No exploitation of a vulnerability is mentioned, but a patch is provided to fix a denial of service vulnerability in the `SparseReshape` function."]}
