{"description": "When investigating issue [#11093](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/11093), [Jeremy Deruss\u00e9](https://connect.sensiolabs.com/profile/jderusse) found a serious code injection issue in the way Symfony implements translation caching in FrameworkBundle.\n\n- Your Symfony application is vulnerable if you meet the following conditions:\n\n- You are using the Symfony translation system from FrameworkBundle (so basically if you are using Symfony full-stack -- you are not affected if you are using the Translation component with Silex for instance);\nYou don't sanitize locales coming from a URL (any route with a _locale argument for instance):\n\nWhen vulnerable, an attacker can submit a non-valid locale value that can contain some PHP code that will be executed by Symfony. That's because the locale value is dumped into a PHP file generated in the cache without being sanitized first.", "methods": ["Injects code through the Symfony translation caching mechanism in FrameworkBundle.", "Uses a non-valid locale value to inject malicious code.", "Executes injected code through a PHP file generated in the cache."]}
