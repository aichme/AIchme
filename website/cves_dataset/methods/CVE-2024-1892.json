{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe following parts of the Scrapy API were found to be vulnerable to a [ReDoS attack](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS):\n\n- The [`XMLFeedSpider`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#scrapy.spiders.XMLFeedSpider) class or any subclass that uses the default node iterator: `iternodes`, as well as direct uses of the `scrapy.utils.iterators.xmliter` function.\n\n- **Scrapy 2.6.0 to 2.11.0**: The [`open_in_browser`](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/debug.html#scrapy.utils.response.open_in_browser) function for a response without a [base tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp). \n\nHandling a malicious response could cause extreme CPU and memory usage during the parsing of its content, due to the use of vulnerable regular expressions for that parsing.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to Scrapy 2.11.1.\n\nIf you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.11.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.4 instead.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nFor `XMLFeedSpider`, switch the node iterator to ``xml`` or ``html``.\n\nFor `open_in_browser`, before using the function, either manually review the response content to discard a ReDos attack or manually define the base tag to avoid its automatic definition by `open_in_browser` later.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThis security issue was reported by @nicecatch2000  [through huntr.com](https://huntr.com/bounties/271f94f2-1e05-4616-ac43-41752389e26b/).\n", "methods": ["Uses ReDoS attack via vulnerable regular expressions in Scrapy API.", "Uses vulnerable Scrapy 2.6.0 to 2.11.0.", "Uses vulnerable Scrapy 1.8 or lower.", "Uses XMLFeedSpider with default node iterator iternodes.", "Uses open_in_browser function without a base tag.", "Uses xmliter function directly."]}
