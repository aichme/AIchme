{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible to exploit a bug in XWikiRights resolution of groups to obtain privilege escalation. \n\nMore specifically, editing a right with the object editor leads to adding a supplementary empty value to groups which is then resolved as a reference to XWiki.WebHome page. Adding an XWikiGroup xobject to that page then transforms it to a group, any user put in that group would then obtain the privileges related to the edited right.\n\nNote that this security issue is normally mitigated by the fact that XWiki.WebHome (and XWiki space in general) should be protected by default for edit rights. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in XWiki 13.10.4 and 14.2RC1 to not consider anymore empty values in XWikiRights. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt's possible to workaround the problem by setting appropriate rights on XWiki.WebHome page to prevent users to edit it. \n\n### References\n\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18386\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-15776\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Exploited a bug in XWikiRights resolution of groups to obtain privilege escalation.", "Added a supplementary empty value to groups which is then resolved as a reference to XWiki.WebHome page.", "Added an XWikiGroup xobject to the XWiki.WebHome page to transform it to a group.", "Edited a right with the object editor to exploit the bug.", "Edited the XWiki.WebHome page to exploit the bug.", "Patched in XWiki 13.10.4 and 14.2RC1 to not consider empty values in XWikiRights.", "Set appropriate rights on XWiki.WebHome page to prevent users to edit it."]}
