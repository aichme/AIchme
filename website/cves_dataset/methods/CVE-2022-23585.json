{"description": "### Impact\nWhen [decoding PNG images](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/decode_image_op.cc#L322-L416) TensorFlow can produce a memory leak if the image is invalid.\nAfter calling `png::CommonInitDecode(..., &decode)`, the `decode` value contains allocated buffers which can only be freed by calling `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)`. However, several error case in the function implementation invoke the `OP_REQUIRES` macro which immediately terminates the execution of the function, without allowing for the memory free to occur.\n  \n### Patches   \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ab51e5b813573dc9f51efa335aebcf2994125ee9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ab51e5b813573dc9f51efa335aebcf2994125ee9).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["Memory leak in decoding PNG images can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.", "The vulnerability is due to the lack of memory deallocation in error cases.", "The issue was patched in GitHub commit ab51e5b813573dc9f51efa335aebcf2994125ee9."]}
