{"description": "A Cross Side Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability was found in Codiad v1.7.8 and later. The request to download a plugin from the marketplace is only available to admin users and it isn't CSRF protected in components/market/controller.php. This might cause admins to make a vulnerable request without them knowing and result in remote code execution. **NOTE:** the vendor states \"Codiad is no longer under active maintenance by core contributors.\"", "methods": ["Used a CSRF vulnerability in Codiad to execute remote code.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Codiad to download a plugin without admin consent.", "Executed code on the server without admin knowledge."]}
