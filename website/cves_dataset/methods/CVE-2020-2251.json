These passwords can be viewed by attackers with Extended Read permission.\n\nThis only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins 2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.", "methods": ["Stored credentials in plain text in Jenkins ReadyAPI Functional Testing Plugin config.xml files.", "Transmitted passwords in plain text as part of the global configuration form.", "Credentials can be viewed by attackers with Extended Read permission."]}
