All installations accepting public traffic are affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nWebhook payload URLs are revalidated before each delivery to make sure they are not resolved to blocked local network addresses. Users should upgrade to 0.12.8 or the latest 0.13.0+dev.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRun Gogs in its own private network.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://huntr.dev/bounties/da1fbd6e-7a02-458e-9c2e-6d226c47046d/\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please post on https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/6901.\n", "methods": ["Used Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to discover internal network services.", "Used Webhook functionality to send malicious requests."]}
