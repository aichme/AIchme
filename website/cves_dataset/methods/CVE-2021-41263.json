{"description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability impacts any Rails applications using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies. Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within a multi-site Rails application.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched in v4 of the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation will vary based on the application architecture.", "methods": ["Uses a vulnerability in Rails applications to share secrets between sites.", "Uses signed/encrypted cookies to bypass security controls.", "Uses a patched vulnerability in the `rails_multisite` gem to gain unauthorized access.", "Uses application architecture to invalidate signed/encrypted cookies."]}
