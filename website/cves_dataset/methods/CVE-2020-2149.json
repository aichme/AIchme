This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.", "methods": ["Credentials transmitted in plain text through a web interface.", "Credentials stored in a configuration file.", "Credentials exposed through browser extensions.", "Credentials exposed through cross-site scripting vulnerabilities."]}
