{"description": "Worksoft Execution Manager Plugin 10.0.3.503 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation. This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins. Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used a CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins Worksoft Execution Manager Plugin to capture credentials.", "Used Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL.", "Used an attacker-specified credentials ID to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.", "Used a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability."]}
