{"description": "### Impact\n\nSince version 2.11.1, Scrapy drops the `Authorization` header when a request is redirected to a different domain. However, it keeps the header if the domain remains the same but the scheme (http/https) or the port change, all scenarios where the header should also be dropped.\n\nIn the context of a man-in-the-middle attack, this could be used to get access to the value of that `Authorization` header\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to Scrapy 2.11.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no easy workaround for unpatched versions of Scrapy. You can replace the built-in redirect middlewares with custom ones patched for this issue, but you have to patch them yourself, manually.\n\n### References\n\nThis security issue was reported and fixed by @szarny at https://huntr.com/bounties/27f6a021-a891-446a-ada5-0226d619dd1a/.\n", "methods": ["Leaks sensitive information (Authorization header) via cross-origin redirects.", "Man-in-the-middle attack."]}
