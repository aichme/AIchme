{"description": "### Impact\n\nPeople that configure mTLS between Traefik and clients.\n\nFor a request, the TLS configuration choice can be different than the router choice, which implies the use of a wrong TLS configuration.\n\n- When sending a request using FQDN handled by a router configured with a dedicated TLS configuration, the TLS configuration falls back to the default configuration that might not correspond to the configured one.\n\n- If the CNAME flattening is enabled, the selected TLS configuration is the SNI one and the routing uses the CNAME value, so this can skip the expected TLS configuration.\n\n### Patches\n\nTraefik v2.6.x: https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.6.1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAdd the FDQN to the host rule:\n\nExample:\n\n```yml\n  whoami:\n    image: traefik/whoami:v1.7.1\n    labels:\n      traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule: Host(`whoami.example.com`, `whoami.example.com.`)\n      traefik.http.routers.whoami.tls: true\n      traefik.http.routers.whoami.tls.options: mtls@file\n```\n\nThere is no workaround if the CNAME flattening is enabled.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues).\n", "methods": ["Skipped router TLS configuration when the host header is an FQDN.", "Used wrong TLS configuration.", "Fallback to default TLS configuration.", "CNAME flattening enabled."]}
