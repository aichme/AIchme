{"description": "### Impact\n\nSimple users can create global SSX/JSX without specific rights: in theory only users with Programming Rights should be allowed to create SSX or JSX that are executed everywhere on a wiki. But a bug allow anyone with edit rights to actually create those. \n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in XWiki 13.10-rc-1, 12.10.11 and 13.4.6. \n\n### Workarounds\nThere's no easy workaround for this issue, administrators should upgrade their wiki.\n\n### References\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19155\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [JIRA](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [XWiki Security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Used Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs to create global SSX/JSX without specific rights.", "Created global SSX/JSX with edit rights."]}
