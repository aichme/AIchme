{"description": "A vulnerability introduced by forcing parameter inclusion in the URL and Anchor Tag allows remote command execution, session access and manipulation and XSS attacks.\n\nboth the s:url and s:a tag provide an includeParams attribute.\n\nThe main scope of that attribute is to understand whether includes http request parameter or not.\n\nThe allowed values of includeParams are:\n\n    none - include no parameters in the URL (default)\n    get - include only GET parameters in the URL\n    all - include both GET and POST parameters in the URL\n\nA request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to inject arbitrary OGNL code into the stack, afterward used as request parameter of an URL or A tag , which will cause a further evaluation.\n\nThe second evaluation happens when the URL/A tag tries to resolve every parameters present in the original request.\nThis lets malicious users put arbitrary OGNL statements into any request parameter (not necessarily managed by the code) and have it evaluated as an OGNL expression to enable method execution and execute arbitrary methods, bypassing Struts and OGNL library protections.\n\nThe issue was originally addressed by Struts 2.3.14.1 and Security Announcement [S2-013](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-013). However, the solution introduced with 2.3.14.1 did not address all possible attack vectors, such that every version of Struts 2 before 2.3.14.2 is still vulnerable to such attacks.", "methods": ["Injects arbitrary OGNL code into the stack through specially crafted request parameters.", "Uses OGNL statements to execute arbitrary methods and bypass protections.", "Executes arbitrary OGNL expressions to enable method execution.", "Injects malicious code into request parameters.", "Uses request parameters to execute arbitrary code.", "Bypasses Struts and OGNL library protections.", "Uses specially crafted request parameters to inject malicious code.", "Executes arbitrary methods through OGNL statements.", "Manipulates request parameters to execute malicious code."]}
