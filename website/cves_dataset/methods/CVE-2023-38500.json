{"description": "> ### CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (4.4)\n\n### Problem\nDue to an encoding issue in the serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of [`typo3/html-sanitizer`](https://packagist.org/packages/typo3/html-sanitizer).\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to `typo3/html-sanitizer` versions 1.5.1 or 2.1.2 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to David Klein and Yaniv Nizry who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 security team members Oliver Hader and Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2023-002](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-002)\n", "methods": ["Bypassed cross-site scripting protection in HTML sanitizer.", "Exploited encoding issue in serialization layer.", "Used malicious markup nested in a noscript element.", "Exploited custom configuration that enabled noscript element."]}
