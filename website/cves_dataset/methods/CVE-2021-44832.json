{"description": "Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to an attack where an attacker with permission to modify the logging configuration file can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.\n\n\n# Affected packages\nOnly the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package is directly affected by this vulnerability. The `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api` should be kept at the same version as the `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-core` package to ensure compatability if in use.\n\nThis issue does not impact default configurations of Log4j2 and requires an attacker to have control over the Log4j2 configuration, which reduces the likelihood of being exploited.", "methods": ["Used a malicious configuration to inject code via a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI.", "Executed remote code via a JNDI URI.", "Modified the logging configuration file to construct a malicious configuration.", "Used a vulnerability in the logging configuration to execute remote code.", "Injected malicious code into the logging configuration file."]}
