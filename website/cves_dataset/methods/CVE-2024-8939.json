{"description": "A vulnerability was found in the ilab model serve component, where improper handling of the best_of parameter in the vllm JSON web API can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). The API used for LLM-based sentence or chat completion accepts a best_of parameter to return the best completion from several options. When this parameter is set to a large value, the API does not handle timeouts or resource exhaustion properly, allowing an attacker to cause a DoS by consuming excessive system resources. This leads to the API becoming unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.", "methods": ["Consumes excessive system resources to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).", "Exploits improper handling of the best_of parameter in the vllm JSON web API.", "Causes the API to become unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service."]}
