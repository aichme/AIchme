{"description": "A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch 7.17.0\u2019s upgrade assistant, in which upgrading from version 6.x to 7.x would disable the in-built protections on the security index, allowing authenticated users with \u201c*\u201d index permissions access to this index. Users running a cluster on an affected version that had previously been upgraded from 6.x, should upgrade to 7.17.1. Users that are planning to upgrade from 6.x should not perform an upgrade from 6.x to versions 7.16 through 7.17.0 and should use 7.17.1+ for upgrades from 6.x.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in Elasticsearch 7.17.0's upgrade assistant to gain access to the security index.", "Exploited \"index permissions\" to access the security index.", "Leveraged a flaw in the upgrade process to disable in-built protections."]}
