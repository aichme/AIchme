{"description": "RosarioSIS prior to 11.0 allows anyone, regardless of authentication status, to download and view file attachments under the `salaries` module. In addition, the file names contain a date in a `YYYY-MM-DD` format and a random six-string digit, making enumerating file names with automated tools relatively easy. This could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive salary information. The patch for version 11.0 adds microseconds to filenames to make them harder to guess.", "methods": ["Allows unauthenticated access to sensitive data.", "Uses predictable file naming conventions.", "Allows enumeration of file names with automated tools.", "Exposes sensitive information."]}
