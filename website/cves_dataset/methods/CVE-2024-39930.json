{"description": "The built-in SSH server of Gogs through 0.13.0 allows argument injection in internal/ssh/ssh.go, leading to remote code execution. Authenticated attackers can exploit this by opening an SSH connection and sending a malicious --split-string env request if the built-in SSH server is activated. Windows installations are unaffected.", "methods": ["Used argument injection in internal/ssh/ssh.go to achieve remote code execution.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the built-in SSH server."]}
