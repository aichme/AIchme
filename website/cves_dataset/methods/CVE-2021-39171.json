{"description": "### Impact\nA malicious SAML payload can require transforms that consume significant system resources to process, thereby resulting in reduced or denied service. This would be an effective way to perform a denial-of-service attack.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been resolved in version 3.1.0. The resolution is to limit the number of allowable transforms to 2.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/node-saml/passport-saml/pull/595\n", "methods": ["Used SAML payload to perform denial-of-service attack.", "Used excessive system resource consumption to reduce or deny service.", "Limited transforms allowed for signed nodes to prevent denial-of-service attack."]}
