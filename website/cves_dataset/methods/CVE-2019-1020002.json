However, because of this you could enter a bad password for a known email and determine if the account exists if you got redirected to a 2FA page.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory please react out on Discord or email dane@[project name].io.", "methods": ["Entered random credentials into login fields to sniff account existence.", "Exploited a logical mistake in the code to verify user's password after 2FA credentials were provided."]}
