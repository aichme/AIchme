{"description": "In PyTorch before trunk/89695, torch.jit.annotations.parse_type_line can cause arbitrary code execution because eval is used unsafely. The fix for this issue is available in version 1.13.1. There is a release checker in [issue #89855](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/89855).", "methods": ["Used unsafely eval to execute arbitrary code."]}
