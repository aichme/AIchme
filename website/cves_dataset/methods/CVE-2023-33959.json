Users should upgrade their notation-go library to [v1.0.0-rc.6](https://github.com/notaryproject/notation-go/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.6) or above.\n\n### Workarounds\nUser should use secure and trusted container registries.\n\n### Credits\nThe `notation` project would like to thank Adam Korczynski (@AdamKorcz) for responsibly disclosing the issue found during an security audit (facilitated by OSTIF and sponsored by CNCF) and Shiwei Zhang (@shizhMSFT), Pritesh Bandi (@priteshbandi)  for root cause analysis.\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in a library to bypass verification.", "Used a compromised registry to lead a user to verify the wrong artifact.", "Used a trusted container registry as a workaround.", "Used a secure container registry as a workaround."]}
