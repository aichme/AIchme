{"description": "## Overview\nOpenFGA is vulnerable to a DoS attack. In some scenarios that depend on the model and tuples used, a call to ListObjects may not  release memory properly. So when a sufficiently high number of those calls are executed, the OpenFGA server can create an \"out of memory\" error and terminate.\n\n## Fix\nUpgrade to v1.4.3. This upgrade is backwards compatible.", "methods": ["The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack.", "The attack can be triggered by making a high number of calls to ListObjects.", "The attack can cause the OpenFGA server to terminate due to an \"out of memory\" error."]}
