{"description": "### Impact\n\nA malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be available over the TechDocs backend API.\n\nThis vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to modify the `mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would also need access to the TechDocs backend API.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability is patched in the `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\n* Visit our chat, linked to in [Backstage README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)", "methods": ["Read sensitive files from the environment by setting a particular path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`.", "Access to the TechDocs backend API."]}
