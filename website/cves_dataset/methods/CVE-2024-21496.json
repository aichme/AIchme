{"description": "All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the Referer header, due to improper input sanitization. Although the Referer header is sanitized by escaping some characters that can allow XSS (e.g., [&], [<], [>], [\"], [']), it does not account for the attack based on the JavaScript URL scheme (e.g., javascript:alert(document.domain)// payload). Exploiting this vulnerability may not be trivial, but it could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the target user\u2019s browser, compromising user sessions.", "methods": ["Used Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the Referer header.", "Exploited JavaScript URL scheme to execute malicious scripts.", "Executed malicious scripts in the context of the target user's browser.", "Compromised user sessions."]}
