{"description": "### Impact\nIf [`BCast::ToShape`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/util/bcast.h) is given input larger than an `int32`, it will crash, despite being supposed to handle up to an `int64`. An example can be seen in [`tf.experimental.numpy.outer`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/util/bcast.h) by passing in large input to the input `b`.\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nvalue = tf.constant(shape=[2, 1024, 1024, 1024], value=False)\ntf.experimental.numpy.outer(a=6,b=value)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8310bf8dd188ff780e7fc53245058215a05bdbe5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8310bf8dd188ff780e7fc53245058215a05bdbe5).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Pattarakrit Rattankul.\n", "methods": ["Crash the application by providing input larger than an `int32` to the `BCast::ToShape` function.", "Use of a large input to the `tf.experimental.numpy.outer` function to trigger the crash."]}
