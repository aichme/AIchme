{"description": "Stash Branch Parameter Plugin stores Stash API passwords in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.StashBranchParameter.StashBranchParameterDefinition.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nWhile the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by Stash Branch Parameter Plugin 0.3.0 and earlier. This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.\n\nThis only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins 2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.", "methods": ["Stored credentials in plain text.", "Transmitted credentials in plain text.", "Exposed credentials through browser extensions.", "Exposed credentials through cross-site scripting vulnerabilities."]}
