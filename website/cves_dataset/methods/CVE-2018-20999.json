{"description": "Affected versions of this crate did not properly reset a streaming state. Resetting a streaming state, without finalising it first, creates incorrect results. The flaw was corrected by not first checking if the state had already been reset, when calling reset().", "methods": ["Used a flaw in the streaming state of the orion crate to create incorrect results.", "Failed to finalize the streaming state before resetting it."]}
