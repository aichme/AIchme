{"description": "PHPMailer versions prior to 6.0.6 and 5.2.27 are vulnerable to an object injection attack by passing phar:// paths into `addAttachment()` and other functions that may receive unfiltered local paths, possibly leading to RCE. See [this article](https://knasmueller.net/5-answers-about-php-phar-exploitation) for more info on this type of vulnerability. Mitigated by blocking the use of paths containing URL-protocol style prefixes such as `phar://`. Reported by Sehun Oh of cyberone.kr.\n\n### Impact\nObject injection, possible remote code execution\n\n### Patches\nFixed in 6.0.6 and 5.2.27\n\n### Workarounds\nValidate and sanitise user input before using.\n\n### References\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19296\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a private issue in [the PHPMailer project](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer)", "methods": ["Object injection via Phar object injection in PHPMailer.", "Remote code execution via Phar object injection in PHPMailer.", "Input validation bypass via unfiltered local paths in PHPMailer functions.", "Use of URL-protocol style prefixes (phar://) in local paths."]}
