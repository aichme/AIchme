{"description": "Affected versions of conquer-once implements Sync for its OnceCell type without restricting it to Sendable types.\n\nThis allows non-Send but Sync types such as MutexGuard to be sent across threads leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption in concurrent programs.\n\nThe issue was fixed by adding a Send constraint to OnceCell.", "methods": ["Implemented a vulnerable library (conquer-once) in a concurrent program.", "Failed to restrict synchronization across threads.", "Allowed non-Send types to be sent across threads.", "Caused undefined behavior and memory corruption."]}
