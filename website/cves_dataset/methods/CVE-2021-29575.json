{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence` allows for stack overflow and/or `CHECK`-fail based denial of service.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput = tf.zeros([1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int32)\nseq_lengths = tf.constant([0], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.ReverseSequence(\n    input=input, seq_lengths=seq_lengths, seq_dim=-2, batch_dim=0)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5b3b071975e01f0d250c928b2a8f901cd53b90a7/tensorflow/core/kernels/reverse_sequence_op.cc#L114-L118) fails to validate that `seq_dim` and `batch_dim` arguments are valid.\n  \nNegative values for `seq_dim` can result in stack overflow or `CHECK`-failure, depending on the version of Eigen code used to implement the operation. Similar behavior can be exhibited by invalid values of `batch_dim`.\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ecf768cbe50cedc0a45ce1ee223146a3d3d26d23](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ecf768cbe50cedc0a45ce1ee223146a3d3d26d23).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution \nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Denial of service through stack overflow.", "Denial of service through CHECK-failure.", "Lack of input validation for seq_dim and batch_dim arguments."]}
