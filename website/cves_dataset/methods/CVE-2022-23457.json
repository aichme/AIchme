{"description": "### Impact\nThe default implementation of `Validator.getValidDirectoryPath(String, String, File, boolean)` may incorrectly treat the tested input string as a child of the specified parent directory. This potentially could allow control-flow bypass checks to be defeated if an attack can specify the entire string representing the 'input' path.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability is patched in release 2.3.0.0 of ESAPI. See https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/releases/tag/esapi-2.3.0.0 for details.\n\n### Workarounds\nYes; in theory, one _could_ write the own implementation of the Validator interface. This would most easily be done by sub-classing a version of the affected `DefaultValidator` class and then overriding the affected `getValidDirectoryPath()` to correct the issue. However, this is not recommended.\n\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email one of the project co-leaders.
