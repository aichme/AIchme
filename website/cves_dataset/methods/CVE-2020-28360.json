An attacker can perform a large range of requests to ARIN reserved IP ranges, resulting in an indeterminable number of critical attack vectors, allowing remote attackers to request server-side resources or potentially execute arbitrary code through various SSRF techniques.", "methods": ["Used Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to request server-side resources.", "Executed arbitrary code through SSRF techniques.", "Requested server-side resources using ARIN reserved IP ranges."]}
