{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe in-toto configuration is read from various directories and allows users to configure the behavior of the framework. The files are from directories following the XDG base directory specification [1]. Among the files read is `.in_totorc` which is a hidden file in the directory in which in-toto is run. If an attacker controls the inputs to a supply chain step, they can mask their activities by also passing in an `.in_totorc` file that includes the necessary exclude patterns and settings.\n\nRC files are widely used in other systems [2] and security issues have been discovered in their implementations as well [3]. We found in our conversations with in-toto adopters that `in_totorc` is not their preferred way to configure in-toto. As none of the options supported in `in_totorc` is unique, and can be set elsewhere using API parameters or CLI arguments, we decided to drop support for `in_totorc`.\n\n### Other Recommendations\n\nSandbox functionary code as recommended in https://github.com/in-toto/docs/security/advisories/GHSA-p86f-xmg6-9q4x.\n\n### References\n\n[1] https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html\n[2] https://spec.editorconfig.org/\n[3] https://github.blog/2022-04-12-git-security-vulnerability-announced/\n", "methods": ["Uses configuration files to mask malicious activities.", "Uses configuration files to control the behavior of the framework.", "Uses configuration files to pass in exclude patterns and settings.", "Uses configuration files to configure the behavior of the framework in a supply chain step."]}
