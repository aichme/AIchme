{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of [`ParseAttrValue`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c22d88d6ff33031aa113e48aa3fc9aa74ed79595/tensorflow/core/framework/attr_value_util.cc#L397-L453) can be tricked into stack overflow due to recursion by giving in a specially crafted input.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e07e1c3d26492c06f078c7e5bf2d138043e199c1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e07e1c3d26492c06f078c7e5bf2d138043e199c1).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["Tricked the implementation of `ParseAttrValue` into a stack overflow due to recursion with specially crafted input.", "Used recursion to cause a stack overflow."]}
