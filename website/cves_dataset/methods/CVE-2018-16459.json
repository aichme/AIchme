{"description": "Versions of `exceljs` before 1.6.0 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. \n\nThis vulnerability is due to `exceljs` not validating data from parsed XLSX file and embedding HTML tags, like `<script>` directly into the sheet cells. Because of this it's possible to inject malicious JavaScript code and execute it when data from the sheet is displayed in the browser.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.6.0 or later.", "methods": ["Injects malicious JavaScript code via unvalidated data from parsed XLSX file.", "Executes malicious JavaScript code when data from the sheet is displayed in the browser."]}
