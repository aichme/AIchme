{"description": "In modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_pxm.cpp, the length of buffer AutoBuffer _src is small than expected, which will cause copy buffer overflow later. If the image is from remote, may lead to remote code execution or denial of service. This affects OpenCV 3.3 (corresponding to OpenCV-Python 3.3.0.9) and earlier.", "methods": ["Copy Buffer Overflow in a buffer named AutoBuffer _src in OpenCV.", "Remote Code Execution via buffer overflow.", "Denial of Service via buffer overflow."]}
