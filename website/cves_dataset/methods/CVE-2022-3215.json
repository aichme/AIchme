{"description": "`NIOHTTP1` and projects using it for generating HTTP responses, including SwiftNIO, can be subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A malicious user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded form) and \"inject\" those newlines into the returned HTTP response.\n\nThis capability allows users to work around security headers and HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or other new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as the response to subsequent requests, which can lead to XSS, cache poisoning, and a number of other flaws.\n\nThis issue was resolved by adding a default channel handler that polices outbound headers. This channel handler is added by default to channel pipelines, but can be removed by users if they are doing this validation themselves.", "methods": ["Injects false HTTP responses to bypass security headers and HTTP framing headers.", "Injects new headers into HTTP responses.", "Injects newlines into HTTP responses to manipulate HTTP framing.", "Uses user-generated input to inject malicious HTTP responses.", "Uses encoded input to inject newlines into HTTP responses.", "Injects false responses to lead to XSS, cache poisoning, and other flaws."]}
