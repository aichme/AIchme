However, the error_message is rendered using the [| safe filter](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/working-with-automatic-escaping), meaning the user input is not escaped.", "methods": ["Used a web application vulnerability (Cross-site Scripting) to inject malicious code.", "Used a web application vulnerability to inject malicious code via a query string parameter.", "Used a web application vulnerability to inject malicious code via a user input field.", "Used a web application vulnerability to inject malicious code that is rendered in an error message."]}
