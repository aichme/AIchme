{"description": "Affected versions of `nw-with-arm` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `nw-with-arm`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees.", "methods": ["Intercept and Replace: An attacker intercepts a request and replaces the response with a malicious executable.", "Lateral Movement: An attacker with a privileged network position can exploit the vulnerability.", "Privilege Escalation: The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain code execution on the system.", "Network Traffic Manipulation: An attacker can intercept and manipulate network traffic to exploit the vulnerability.", "Supply Chain Compromise: The vulnerability is introduced through a compromised package."]}
