{"description": "### Impact\nInternal usage of Oort and Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could subscribe and publish to those channels.\nBy subscribing to those channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic that contains other user's (possibly sensitive) data.\nBy publishing to those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete other user's data and modify the cluster structure.\nThe issue impacts any version up to 5.0.10, 6.0.5 and 7.0.5.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in 5.0.11, 6.0.6 and 7.0.6.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe workaround is to install a custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.\nThis workaround could be implemented in any affected version.\n\n### References\ncometd/cometd#1146\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@webtide.com](mailto:security@webtide.com)\n\n### Credits\nhttps://www.redteam-pentesting.de/", "methods": ["Improperly authorized access to internal channels (Oort and Seti) for remote users.", "Ability to watch internal traffic containing sensitive data.", "Ability to create, modify, or delete other users' data.", "Ability to modify cluster structure.", "Ability to subscribe to and publish to channels without proper authorization."]}
