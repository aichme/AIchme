{"description": "### Impact\nThe GeoServer security mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution. The same can happen while configuring data stores with data sources located in JNDI, or while setting up the disk quota mechanism.\nIn order to perform any of the above changes, the attack needs to have obtained admin rights and use either the GeoServer GUI, or its REST API.\n\n### Patches\nThe lookups are going to be restricted in GeoServer 2.21.0, 2.20.4, 2.19.6.\n\n### Workarounds\nProtection can be achieved by making the GUI (``geoserver/web``), the REST configuration (``geoserver/rest``) and the embedded GeoWebCache configuration (``geoserver/gwc/rest``) unreachable from remote hosts, in addition to protecting access to the file system where the GeoServer configuration is stored.\n\n\n", "methods": ["Performs unchecked JNDI lookup to perform class deserialization and achieve arbitrary code execution.", "Uses GeoServer GUI or REST API to perform changes with admin rights.", "Uses GeoServer GUI, REST configuration, and embedded GeoWebCache configuration to perform changes.", "Uses file system access to store and retrieve configuration."]}
