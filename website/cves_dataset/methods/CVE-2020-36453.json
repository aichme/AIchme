This allows (1) creating data races to a `T: !Sync` and (2) sending `T: !Send` to other threads, resulting in memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n", "methods": ["Created data races in a Rust crate (scottqueue) through unconditional implementations of Send and Sync for Queue<T>.", "Created data races to a `T: !Sync`.", "Sent `T: !Send` to other threads."]}
