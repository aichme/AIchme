{"description": "# Withdrawn\n\nThis advisory was initially published and mapped incorrectly to nuget `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Ref`. We later reanalyzed this advisory and found it does not have a direct mapping to a NuGet package.  Thus we have withdrawn this advisory.\n\nThe underlying ASP.NET Core Denial of Service Vulnerability and CVE-2021-31957 remain legitimate.\n\n# Description.\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0 and .NET Core 3.1. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\n\nA denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles client disconnect. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\n\n\n### Patches\n\n* If you're using .NET 5.0, you should download and install Runtime 5.0.7 or SDK 5.0.204 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.8) or SDK 5.0.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 16.10) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5.0.\n\n* If you're using .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.16 or SDK 3.1.116 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.410 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\n\n\n\n#### Other Details\n\n- Announcement for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/188\n- An Issue for this can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/33369\n- MSRC details for this can be found at https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31957\n", "methods": ["None."]}
