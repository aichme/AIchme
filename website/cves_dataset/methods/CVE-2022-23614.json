{"description": "# Description\n\nWhen in a sandbox mode, the `arrow` parameter of the `sort` filter must be a closure to avoid attackers being able to run arbitrary PHP functions.\n\n# Resolution\n\nWe now disallow calling non Closure in the `sort` filter like we already did for some other filters.\n\n# Credits\n\nWe would like to thank Marlon Starkloff for reporting the issue and Fabien Potencier for fixing the issue.\n", "methods": ["Used arbitrary PHP function execution in a sandbox mode.", "Disallowed calling non-Closure in the `sort` filter."]}
