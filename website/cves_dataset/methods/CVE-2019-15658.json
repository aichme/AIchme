{"description": "### Impact\nAn unlikely SQL injection if the case of an unsanitized table name input.\n\n### Patches\nThe user should upgrade to `6.0.1`. Due to its low impact a backport has not been made to the `5.x` branch.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf there is no likelihood that the `tableName` or `schemaName` options sent to the constructor could be of an unsanitized nature, then no workaround is needed. Else the input could be sanitized and escaped before sending it in. Take note though that such an escaping would need to be removed when upgrading to `6.0.1` or later, to avoid double escaping.\n\n### References\n* [Security issue disclosure](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-connect-pg-simple/issues/151)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [voxpelli/node-connect-pg-simple](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-connect-pg-simple)\n* Email maintainer at [pelle@kodfabrik.se](mailto:pelle@kodfabrik.se)\n", "methods": ["SQL injection via unsanitized table name input."]}
