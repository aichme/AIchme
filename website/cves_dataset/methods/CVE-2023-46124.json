{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe Fides web application allows a custom integration to be uploaded as a ZIP file containing configuration and dataset definitions in YAML format. \n\nIt was discovered that specially crafted YAML dataset and config files allow a malicious user to perform arbitrary requests to internal systems and exfiltrate data outside the environment (also known as a Server-Side Request Forgery). The application does not perform proper validation to block attempts to connect to internal (including localhost) resources.\n\nExploitation is limited to API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner role.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.22.1`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no workarounds.\n", "methods": ["Used Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to perform arbitrary requests to internal systems and exfiltrate data.", "Used YAML files to perform SSRF.", "Used API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization scope to exploit the vulnerability.", "Used a ZIP file to upload a malicious custom integration to the Fides web application."]}
