{"description": "### Summary\nA log injection vulnerability was identified in `pyload`. This vulnerability allows any unauthenticated actor to inject arbitrary messages into the logs gathered by `pyload`.\n\n### Details\n`pyload` will generate a log entry when attempting to sign in with faulty credentials. This entry will be in the form of `Login failed for user 'USERNAME'`. However, when supplied with a username containing a newline, this newline is not properly escaped. Newlines are also the delimiter between log entries. This allows the attacker to inject new log entries into the log file.\n\n### PoC\nRun `pyload` in the default configuration by running the following command\n```\npyload\n```\n\nWe can now sign in as the pyload user and view the logs at `http://localhost:8000/logs`.\n![Viewing the logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294433796-f2c96e39-8000-4649-99bb-9c50e786243d.png)\n\nAny unauthenticated attacker can now make the following request to inject arbitrary logs.\n\n```\ncurl 'http://localhost:8000/login?next=http://localhost:8000/' -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data-raw $'do=login&username=wrong\\'%0a[2024-01-05 02:49:19]  HACKER               PinkDraconian  THIS ENTRY HAS BEEN INJECTED&password=wrong&submit=Login'\n```\n\nIf we now were to look at the logs again, we see that the entry has successfully been injected.\n![PoC2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294434785-2fc6dce4-3e2c-4da0-8e80-a6bba882f756.png)\n\n### Impact\nForged or otherwise, corrupted log files can be used to cover an attacker\u2019s tracks or even to implicate another party in the commission of a malicious act.\n", "methods": ["Injects arbitrary messages into logs gathered by pyload.", "Uses newline characters to inject new log entries into the log file.", "Uses a POST request to inject logs.", "Uses a malicious username containing a newline character to inject logs.", "Uses a specially crafted HTTP request to inject logs.", "Injects logs without authentication."]}
