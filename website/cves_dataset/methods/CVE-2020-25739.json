{"description": "An issue was discovered in the gon gem before gon-6.4.0 for Ruby. MultiJson does not honor the escape_mode parameter to escape fields as an XSS protection mechanism. To mitigate, json_dumper.rb in gon now does escaping for XSS by default without relying on MultiJson.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable library (gon gem) to inject malicious code.", "Failed to properly escape user input to prevent XSS attacks."]}
