{"description": "### Vulnerability type\nAccess Controls\n\n### Detail\netcd creates certain directory paths (etcd data directory and the directory path when provided to automatically generate self-signed certificates for TLS connections with clients) with restricted access permissions (700) by using the os.MkdirAll. This function does not perform any permission checks when a given directory path exists already.\n### Specific Go Package Affected\ngithub.com/etcd-io/etcd/pkg/fileutil\n### Workarounds\nMake sure these directories have the desired permit (700).\n\n### References\nFind out more on this vulnerability in the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Contact the [etcd security committee](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/security-release-process.md#product-security-committee-psc)", "methods": ["etcd creates directories with restricted access permissions (700) without permission checks.", "etcd uses the os.MkdirAll function to create directories."]}
