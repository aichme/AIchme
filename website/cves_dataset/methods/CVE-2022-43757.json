{"description": "### Impact\n\nThis issue affects Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.16, from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0. It was discovered that the security advisory CVE-2021-36782 (GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f), previously released by Rancher, missed addressing some sensitive fields, secret tokens, encryption keys, and SSH keys that were still being stored in plaintext directly on Kubernetes objects like `Clusters`.\n\nThe exposed credentials are visible in Rancher to authenticated `Cluster Owners`, `Cluster Members`, `Project Owners` and `Project Members` of that cluster on the endpoints:\n\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.cluster`\n- `/v1/management.cattle.io.clustertemplaterevisions`\n\nThe remaining sensitive fields are now stripped from `Clusters` and other objects and moved to a `Secret` before the object is stored. The `Secret` is retrieved when the credential is needed. For objects that existed before this security fix, a one-time migration happens on startup.\n\nThe fields that have been addressed by this security fix are:\n\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESGCM.Keys[].Secret`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESCBC.Keys[].Secret`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].SecretboxConfiguration.Keys[].Secret`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.Kubelet.ExtraEnv` when containing the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.BastionHost.SSHKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSecretAccessKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSessionToken`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.ApicUserKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.KafkaClientKey`\n- `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.Token`\n\n**Important:**\n\n- For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions the leaked credentials have on their services.\n\n- It is recommended to review for potentially leaked credentials in this scenario and to change them if deemed necessary.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no direct mitigation besides updating Rancher to a patched version.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatched versions include releases 2.5.17, 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions.\n\nAfter upgrading to a patched version, it is important to check for the `ACISecretsMigrated` and `RKESecretsMigrated` conditions on `Clusters` and `ClusterTemplateRevisions` to confirm when secrets have been fully migrated off of those objects, and the objects scoped within them.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.\n* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).", "methods": ["Stored sensitive data in plaintext in Rancher API and cluster.management.cattle.io objects.", "Exposed credentials in Rancher to authenticated users with access to clusters and projects.", "Failed to address sensitive fields, secret tokens, encryption keys, and SSH keys in previous security advisory CVE-2021-36782.", "Stored AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variable in Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.Kubelet.ExtraEnv.", "Stored SSH keys in Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.BastionHost.SSHKey.", "Stored ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSecretAccessKey and ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSessionToken in Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].", "Stored ApicUserKey and KafkaClientKey in Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.", "Stored Token in Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider."]}
