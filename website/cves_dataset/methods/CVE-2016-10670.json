{"description": "Affected versions of `windows-seleniumjar-mirror` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `windows-seleniumjar-mirror`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability.\n\nCurrently, the best mitigation is to download the selenium jar file manually from [seleniumHQ](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).\n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees.", "methods": ["Downloads executable over unencrypted HTTP connection.", "Allows for interception and replacement of executable by an attacker with a privileged network position.", "Allows for code execution on the system running `windows-seleniumjar-mirror`."]}
