{"description": "An XSS vulnerability was discovered in the python `lxml` clean module versions before 4.6.3. When disabling `the safe_attrs_only` and `forms` arguments, the `Cleaner` class does not remove the `formaction` attribute allowing for JS to bypass the sanitizer. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary JS code on users who interact with incorrectly sanitized HTML. This issue is patched in `lxml` 4.6.3.", "methods": ["Used a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `lxml` library to run arbitrary JavaScript code.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the `lxml` library to bypass sanitization of HTML attributes."]}
