{"description": "Denial of service in `SitemapLoader` Document Loader in the `langchain-community` package, affecting versions below 0.2.5. The `parse_sitemap` method, responsible for parsing sitemaps and extracting URLs, lacks a mechanism to prevent infinite recursion when a sitemap URL refers to the current sitemap itself. This oversight allows for the possibility of an infinite loop, leading to a crash by exceeding the maximum recursion depth in Python. This vulnerability can be exploited to occupy server socket/port resources and crash the Python process, impacting the availability of services relying on this functionality.", "methods": ["Exploited a lack of input validation in the `parse_sitemap` method.", "Caused a denial of service by inducing an infinite recursion.", "Occupied server socket/port resources.", "Crashed the Python process.", "Impacted the availability of services."]}
