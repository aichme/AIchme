{"description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nA user with permissions to view Dynamic Group records (`extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission) can use the Dynamic Group detail UI view (`/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/`) and/or the members REST API view (`/api/extras/dynamic-groups/<uuid>/members/`) to list the objects that are members of a given Dynamic Group. \n\nIn versions of Nautobot between 1.3.0 (where the Dynamic Groups feature was added) and 1.6.22 inclusive, and 2.0.0 through 2.2.4 inclusive, Nautobot fails to restrict these listings based on the member object permissions - for example a Dynamic Group of Device objects will list all Devices that it contains, regardless of the user's `dcim.view_device` permissions or lack thereof.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nFixed in Nautobot 1.6.23 and 2.2.5.\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nThis vulnerability can be partially mitigated by removing `extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission from users; a full fix will require upgrading.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5757\n- https://github.com/nautobot/nautobot/pull/5762", "methods": ["A user with elevated permissions can view sensitive information without proper authorization.", "A user can list objects that are members of a given Dynamic Group without proper permissions.", "The vulnerability allows a user to bypass permission restrictions on member objects.", "The issue is due to a lack of permission checks in the Dynamic Group detail UI view and members REST API view.", "The vulnerability can be partially mitigated by removing the `extras.view_dynamicgroup` permission from users."]}
