{"description": "Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, LTS 2.277.1 and earlier does not properly check that a newly created view has an allowed name. When a form to create a view is submitted, the name is included twice in the submission. One instance is validated, but the other instance is used to create the value.\n\nThis allows attackers with View/Create permission to create views with invalid or already-used names.\n\nJenkins 2.287, LTS 2.277.2 uses the same submitted value for validation and view creation.", "methods": ["Bypassed input validation in Jenkins view creation.", "Created views with invalid or already-used names.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, and Jenkins 2.287 and earlier."]}
