{"description": "### Impact\n\nIn the Shopware CMS, the state handler for orders fails to sufficiently verify user authorizations for actions that modify the payment, delivery, and/or order status. Due to this inadequate implementation, users lacking 'write' permissions for orders are still able to change the order state.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to Shopware 6.5.7.4\n\n### Workarounds\nFor older versions of 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4 corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. For the full range of functions, we recommend updating to the latest Shopware version.", "methods": ["Failed to sufficiently verify user authorizations for actions that modify the payment, delivery, and/or order status.", "Users lacking 'write' permissions for orders are still able to change the order state."]}
