{"description": "When aborting a task with JoinHandle::abort, the future is dropped in the thread calling abort if the task is not currently being executed. This is incorrect for tasks spawned on a LocalSet. This can easily result in race conditions as many projects use Rc or RefCell in their Tokio tasks for better performance.", "methods": ["Used a race condition in tokio to create a vulnerability.", "Used a LocalSet to spawn tasks.", "Used Rc or RefCell in Tokio tasks for performance."]}
