{"description": "ncurses exposes functions from the ncurses library which:\n* Pass buffers without length to C functions that may write an arbitrary amount of data, leading to a buffer overflow. (instr, mvwinstr, etc)\n* Passes rust &str to strings expecting C format arguments, allowing hostile input to execute a format string attack, which trivially allows writing arbitrary data to stack memory (functions in the printw family).\n", "methods": ["Passes buffers without length to C functions that may write an arbitrary amount of data, leading to a buffer overflow.", "Passes rust &str to strings expecting C format arguments, allowing hostile input to execute a format string attack."]}
