{"description": "### Impact\nBrute force vulnerability when using password authentication via Sorcery. The brute force protection submodule will prevent a brute force attack for the defined lockout period, but once expired protection will not be re-enabled until a user or malicious actor logs in successfully. This does not affect users that do not use the built-in brute force protection submodule, nor users that use permanent account lockout.\n\n### Patches\nPatched as of version `0.15.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\nCurrently no workarounds, other than monkey patching the authenticate method provided by Sorcery or upgrading to version `0.15.0`.", "methods": ["Brute force attack via password authentication.", "Exploitation of a vulnerability in Sorcery's brute force protection submodule.", "Account lockout bypass."]}
