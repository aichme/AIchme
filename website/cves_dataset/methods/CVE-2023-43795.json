{"description": "### Summary\n\nThe OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) specification is designed to process information from any server using GET and POST requests.\n\nThis presents the opportunity for Server Side Request Forgery.\n\n## Details\n\nThis vulnerability requires:\n\n* The WPS extension to be installed\n* The WPS security setting \"Disable complex inputs\" to be unselected\n* Security URL checks to be disabled\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability presents the opportunity for Server Side Request Forgery.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nThe ability to reference an external URL location is defined by the WPS standard Execute operation. This operations is defined by an Industry and International standard and cannot be redefined by the GeoServer application in isolation.\n\nTo disable complex remote inputs on GeoServer 2.20.5 and GeoServer 2.21.0:\n\n1.  Navigate to **Security > WPS Security** page\n2. Locate **Complex Inputs** heading\n3. Select the check box for **Disable loading complex inputs from remote references**\n\n### Resolution\n\nTo allow processing of complex inputs safely in GeoServer 2.22.5 and GeoServer 2.23.2:\n\n1. Navigate to **Security > URL Checks**\n2. Enable **URL Checks** are enabled setting\n3. Check the user manual for [examples](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/security/urlchecks.html#example-regex-patterns) of how to trust specific locations for your external services.\n\nProcessing of complex inputs safely is on by default in GeoServer 2.24.0.\n\n### References\n\n* [Complex Inputs](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wps/security.html#complex-inputs)\n* [URL Checks](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/security/urlchecks.html)\n", "methods": ["Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via WPS specification.", "Uses GET and POST requests to process information from any server.", "Requires WPS extension to be installed.", "Requires WPS security setting \"Disable complex inputs\" to be unselected.", "Requires security URL checks to be disabled.", "Uses complex remote inputs.", "Uses external URL locations.", "Uses URL checks to process complex inputs safely."]}
