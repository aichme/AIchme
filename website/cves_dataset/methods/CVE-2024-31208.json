{"description": "### Impact\n\nA remote Matrix user with malicious intent, sharing a room with Synapse instances before 1.105.1, can dispatch specially crafted events to exploit a weakness in how the auth chain cover index is calculated. This can induce high CPU consumption and accumulate excessive data in the database of such instances, resulting in a denial of service.\n\nServers in private federations, or those that do not federate, are not affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nServer administrators should upgrade to 1.105.1 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOne can:\n- ban the malicious users or ACL block servers from the rooms; and/or\n- leave the room and purge the room using the admin API\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security AT element.io](mailto:security@element.io).", "methods": ["Exploited a weakness in the auth chain cover index calculation to induce high CPU consumption and accumulate excessive data in the database.", "Caused a Denial of Service (DoS) condition."]}
