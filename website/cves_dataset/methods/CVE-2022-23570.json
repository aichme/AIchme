{"description": "### Impact\nWhen decoding a tensor from protobuf, TensorFlow might do a null-dereference if attributes of some mutable arguments to some operations are missing from the proto. This is [guarded by a `DCHECK`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/full_type_util.cc#L104-L106):\n\n```cc\n  const auto* attr = attrs.Find(arg->s()); \n  DCHECK(attr != nullptr);\n  if (attr->value_case() == AttrValue::kList) {\n    // ...\n  }\n```\nHowever, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the dereferencing of the null pointer, whereas in the second case it results in a crash due to the assertion failure.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8a513cec4bec15961fbfdedcaa5376522980455c](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8a513cec4bec15961fbfdedcaa5376522980455c).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["Null pointer dereference in TensorFlow code.", "Execution of code with missing attributes in proto.", "Assertion failure in debug builds.", "Crash due to assertion failure.", "Execution proceeds to dereferencing of null pointer in production builds."]}
