We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by r3pwnx", "methods": ["Integer overflow in EditDistance function in TensorFlow.", "Deadlock caused by integer overflow.", "Use of GitHub commit to patch the issue.", "Cherrypicking the patch in TensorFlow 2.11.1.", "Use of a security guide for more information.", "Attribution to r3pwnx for reporting the vulnerability."]}
