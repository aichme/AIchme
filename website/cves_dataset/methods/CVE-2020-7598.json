{"description": "Affected versions of `minimist` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  \nParsing the argument `--__proto__.y=Polluted` adds a `y` property with value `Polluted` to all objects. The argument `--__proto__=Polluted` raises and uncaught error and crashes the application.  \nThis is exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `minimist`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to versions 0.2.1, 1.2.3 or later.", "methods": ["Manipulated object properties to add malicious data to all objects.", "Injected malicious data into the application's prototype.", "Used command-line arguments to execute malicious code.", "Exploited a vulnerability in a library to gain control over application behavior."]}
