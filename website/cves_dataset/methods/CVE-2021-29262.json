Additionally, with any ZkACLProvider, if the security.json is already present, Solr will not automatically update the ACLs.", "methods": ["Misconfigured permissions on a web application (Apache Solr).", "Lack of proper access control on sensitive data (security.json znode).", "Failure to update access control lists (ACLs) on existing security.json."]}
