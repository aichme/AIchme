{"description": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in MoinMoin 1.5.8 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) certain input processed by `formatter/text_gedit.py` (aka the gui editor formatter); (2) a page name, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when the page is successfully deleted by a victim in a DeletePage action; or (3) the destination page name for a RenamePage action, which triggers an injection in PageEditor.py when a victim's rename attempt fails because of a duplicate name.  NOTE: the AttachFile XSS issue is already covered by CVE-2008-0781, and the login XSS issue is already covered by CVE-2008-0780.\nThe issue has been fixed on [d0152eeb4499](http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.5/rev/d0152eeb4499) and [4ede07e792dd](http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.5/rev/4ede07e792dd).", "methods": ["Injected arbitrary web script or HTML via input processed by `formatter/text_gedit.py`.", "Injected arbitrary web script or HTML via page name in a DeletePage action.", "Injected arbitrary web script or HTML via destination page name for a RenamePage action."]}
