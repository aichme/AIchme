{"description": "### Impact\nPrism's [Command line plugin](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/) can be used by attackers to achieve an XSS attack. The Command line plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text being inserted into the DOM as HTML code.\n\nServer-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the Command Line plugin are also not impacted.\n\n### Patches\nThis bug has been fixed in v1.27.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not use the Command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitized all code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use the Command line plugin.\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/3341", "methods": ["Used Cross-site Scripting (XSS) to achieve an attack.", "Failed to properly escape output, allowing input text to be inserted into the DOM as HTML code.", "Used the Command line plugin to inject malicious code.", "Failed to sanitize code blocks, allowing untrusted inputs to be executed."]}
