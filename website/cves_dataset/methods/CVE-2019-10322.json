{"description": "Jenkins Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.\n\nAdditionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.", "methods": ["Used a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.", "Used a missing permission check in the Jenkins Artifactory Plugin to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs."]}
