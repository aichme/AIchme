{"description": "All versions of `dset` prior to 3.1.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via `dset/merge` mode, as the `dset` function checks for prototype pollution by validating if the top-level path contains `__proto__`, `constructor` or `prototype`. By crafting a malicious object, it is possible to bypass this check and achieve prototype pollution.", "methods": ["Used Prototype Pollution via `dset/merge` mode.", "Bypassed validation checks by crafting a malicious object.", "Achieved Prototype Pollution."]}
