{"description": "### Impact\n\nOpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in v4.9.3.\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in OpenZeppelin Contracts to execute malicious code.", "Exploited improper escaping of output in ERC2771Context.", "Used a custom trusted forwarder to bypass security measures.", "Exploited a combination of circumstances to return address(0) in calls."]}
