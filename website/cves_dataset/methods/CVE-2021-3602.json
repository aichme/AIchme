{"description": "### Impact\nWhen running processes using \"chroot\" isolation, the process being run can examine the environment variables of its immediate parent and grandparent processes (CVE-2021-3602).  This isolation type is often used when running `buildah` in unprivileged containers, and it is often used to do so in CI/CD environments.  If sensitive information is exposed to the original `buildah` process through its environment, that information will unintentionally be shared with child processes which it starts as part of handling RUN instructions or during `buildah run`.  The commands that `buildah` is instructed to run can read that information if they choose to.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade packages, or images which contain packages, to include version 1.21.3 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nAs a workaround, invoking `buildah` in a container under `env -i` to have it started with a reinitialized environment should prevent the leakage.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah/issues)\n* Email us at [the buildah general mailing list](mailto:buildah@lists.buildah.io), or [the podman security mailing list](mailto:security@lists.podman.io) if it's sensitive.", "methods": ["Leaks environment values to intermediate processes through chroot isolation.", "Leaks sensitive information to child processes started by buildah.", "Uses environment variables to share information between processes.", "Uses buildah in unprivileged containers with chroot isolation.", "Uses buildah in CI/CD environments with chroot isolation."]}
