{"description": "All versions of `status-board` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting. The `renderJsDashboard()` function concatenates the `safeDashboard` variable to the HTTP response message with insufficient sanitization.

Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.", "methods": ["Used Cross-Site Scripting to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.", "Used user input to control the `safeDashboard` variable."]}
