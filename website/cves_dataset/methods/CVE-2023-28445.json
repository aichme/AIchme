{"description": "### Impact\n\n[Resizable ArrayBuffers](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-resizablearraybuffer) passed to asynchronous native functions that are shrunk during the asynchronous operation could result in an out-of-bound read/write.\n\nIt is unlikely that this has been exploited in the wild, as the only version affected is Deno 1.32.0.\n\nDeno Deploy users are not affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been resolved by disabling resizable ArrayBuffers temporarily in Deno 1.32.1. A future version of Deno will re-enable resizable ArrayBuffers with a proper fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrade to Deno 1.32.1, or run with `--v8-flags=--no-harmony-rab-gsab` to disable resizable ArrayBuffers.", "methods": ["Deno has a vulnerability that allows for out-of-bound read/write due to improper handling of resizable ArrayBuffer.", "The vulnerability is in Deno 1.32.0 and has not been exploited in the wild.", "Deno 1.32.1 disables resizable ArrayBuffers as a temporary fix.", "Deno Deploy users are not affected.", "Upgrade to Deno 1.32.1 or run with `--v8-flags=--no-harmony-rab-gsab` to disable resizable ArrayBuffers."]}
