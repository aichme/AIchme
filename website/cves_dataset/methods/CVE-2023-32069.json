{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible for a user to execute anything with the right of the author of the XWiki.ClassSheet document.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1. Edit your user profile with the object editor and add an object of type `DocumentSheetBinding` with value `Default Class Sheet`\n1. Edit your user profile with the wiki editor and add the syntax `{{async}}{{groovy}}println(\"Hello \" + \"from groovy!\"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}`\n1. Click \"Save & View\"\n\n**Expected result:**\n\nAn error is displayed as the user doesn't have the right to execute the Groovy macro.\n\n**Actual result:**\n\nThe text \"Hello from groovy!\" is displayed at the top of the document.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1 and 14.10.4.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for it.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20566\nhttps://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/de72760d4a3e1e9be64a10660a0c19e9534e2ec4\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n*    Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n*    Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in XWiki.ClassSheet document to execute arbitrary code.", "Executed Groovy macro with elevated privileges.", "Used the \"async\" and \"groovy\" syntax to execute code remotely.", "Added malicious code to a user's profile using the object editor.", "Added malicious code to a user's profile using the wiki editor.", "Executed code with the right of the author of the XWiki.ClassSheet document."]}
