{"description": "### Impact\nThe [Livetable Macro](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Livetable%20Macro) wasn't properly sanitizing column names, thus allowing the insertion of raw HTML code including JavaScript. This vulnerability was also exploitable via the [Documents Macro](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Documents%20Macro) that is included since XWiki 3.5M1 and doesn't require script rights, this can be demonstrated with the syntax `{{documents id=\"example\" count=\"5\" actions=\"false\" columns=\"doc.title, before<script>alert(1)</script>after\"/}}`. Therefore, this can also be exploited by users without script right and in comments. With the interaction of a user with more rights, this could be used to execute arbitrary actions in the wiki, including privilege escalation, remote code execution, information disclosure, modifying or deleting content.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10.\n\n### Workarounds\nIt is possible to apply the [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/65ca06c51e7a1d5a579344c7272b2cc9a9a21126) to existing installations without upgrading. Only the files `skins/flamingo/macros.vm` and `templates/macros.vm` in the web application directory need to be replaced by a patched version.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Used XSS to execute arbitrary actions in the wiki, including privilege escalation, remote code execution, information disclosure, modifying or deleting content.", "Injected raw HTML code including JavaScript into column names.", "Exploited the Documents Macro to execute arbitrary actions without script rights.", "Used user interaction with more rights to execute arbitrary actions in the wiki.", "Modified or deleted content in the wiki."]}
