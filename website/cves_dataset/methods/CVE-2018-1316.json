{"description": "The ODE process deployment web service was sensible to deployment messages with forged names. Using a path for the name was allowing directory traversal, resulting in the potential writing of files under unwanted locations, the overwriting of existing files or their deletion. This issue was addressed in Apache ODE 1.3.3 which was released in 2009, however the incorrect name CVE-2008-2370 was used on the advisory by mistake.", "methods": ["Used path traversal to write files to unintended locations.", "Used path traversal to overwrite existing files.", "Used path traversal to delete files.", "Used a vulnerability in a web service to write files to unintended locations.", "Used a vulnerability in a web service to overwrite existing files.", "Used a vulnerability in a web service to delete files."]}
