{"description": "Affected versions of `steroids` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `steroids`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and reported in 2016, yet has not seen a patch issued as of 03/2018. As of 08/2022, [the package is marked as deprecated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/steroids) and the GitHub repository is no longer publicly available.\n\nThe best path forward for mitigating this issue is to attempt to use an alternative module that is actively maintained and which provides similar functionality, such as the native PhoneGap API.", "methods": ["Intercept and replace a response to a network request.", "Execute code on a system.", "Download resources over an unencrypted HTTP connection."]}
