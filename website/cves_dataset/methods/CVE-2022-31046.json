This allows authenticated users to export internal details of database tables to which they already have access.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 7.6.57 ELTS, 8.7.47 ELTS, 9.5.35 ELTS, 10.4.29, 11.5.11 that fix the problem described above.\n\nIn order to address this issue, access to mentioned export functionality is completely denied for regular backend users.\n\n\u2139\ufe0f  **Strong security defaults - Manual actions required**\nFollowing User TSconfig setting would allow using the export functionality for particular users:\n```\noptions.impexp.enableExportForNonAdminUser = 1\n```\n\n### Credits\nThanks to TYPO3 core merger Lina Wolf who reported this issue and to TYPO3 security member Torben Hansen  who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-001](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-001)", "methods": ["The export functionality fails to limit the result set to allowed columns of a particular database table, allowing authenticated users to export internal details of database tables to which they already have access.", "Access to the export functionality is completely denied for regular backend users.", "The User TSconfig setting \"options.impexp.enableExportForNonAdminUser = 1\" would allow using the export functionality for particular users."]}
