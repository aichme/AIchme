{"description": "An issue was discovered in the xcb crate through 2021-02-04 for Rust. It has a soundness violation because transmutation to the wrong type can happen after xcb::base::cast_event uses std::mem::transmute to return a reference to an arbitrary type.", "methods": ["Used a soundness violation in the xcb crate through transmutation to the wrong type.", "Leveraged std::mem::transmute to return a reference to an arbitrary type."]}
