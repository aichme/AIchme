{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt was observed that the `/admin/misc/script-proxy` API endpoint accessible by an authenticated administrator user and is vulnerable arbitrary JavaScript, CSS file read via the \"scriptPath\" and \"scripts\" parameters. The \"scriptPath\" parameter is not sanitized properly and is vulnerable to path traversal attack. Any JavaScript/CSS file from the application server can be read by specifying sufficient number of \"../\" patterns to go out from the application webroot followed by path of the folder where the file is located in the \"scriptPath\" parameter and the file name in the \"scripts\" parameter. The JavaScript file is successfully read only if the web application has read access to it.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to version 10.5.21 or apply this patch manually https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/1d128404eddf4beb560d434437347da7aea059eb.patch\n\n### Workarounds\nApply patch https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/1d128404eddf4beb560d434437347da7aea059eb.patch manually.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/14959\n", "methods": ["Used path traversal to read arbitrary JavaScript and CSS files.", "Leveraged a vulnerable API endpoint to read files.", "Failed to sanitize the \"scriptPath\" parameter.", "Used the \"scriptPath\" and \"scripts\" parameters to read files.", "Required read access to the target file."]}
