{"description": "### Impact\nPrior to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related to memory operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the crate can over-allocate memory when it is not needed, making it possible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack.\n\n### Patches\nThe flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`. Users should upgrade to `==0.21.1, ==0.23.1, ==0.24.1, ==0.25.1, >=0.26.1`.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone. Please upgrade your `evm` crate version\n\n### References\nFix commit: https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm/commit/19ade858c430ab13eb562764a870ac9f8506f8dd\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [evm repo](https://github.com/rust-blockchain/evm)\n* Email [Wei](mailto:wei@that.world)\n", "methods": ["Denial of Service (DoS) attack via memory over-allocation."]}
