{"description": "Jenkins Mask Passwords Plugin 3.0 and earlier does not escape the name and description of Non-Stored Password parameters on views displaying parameters, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the \\\"Build With Parameters\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities of this kind on the \\\"Build With Parameters\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the [SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions) fix.", "methods": ["Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Jenkins Mask Passwords Plugin.", "Exploitation of stored XSS vulnerability.", "Use of Item/Configure permission to exploit vulnerability.", "Exploitation of vulnerabilities on \"Build With Parameters\" and \"Parameters\" pages.", "Use of unhardened pages to prevent exploitation.", "Use of stored XSS to inject malicious scripts."]}
