{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe HTML macro does not systematically perform a proper neutralization of script-related html tags. As a result, any user able to use the html macro in XWiki, is able to introduce an XSS attack. This can be particularly dangerous since in a standard wiki, any user is able to use the html macro directly in their own user profile page. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in XWiki 14.8RC1. The patch involve that the HTML macro are systematically cleaned up whenever the user does not have script right. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere's no workaround for this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML and raw macro in XWiki.", "User able to introduce an XSS attack in a standard wiki.", "User able to use the HTML macro in their own user profile page."]}
