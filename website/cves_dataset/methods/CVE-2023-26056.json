{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible to execute a script with the right of another user (provided the target user does not have programming right).\n\nFor example, the following:\n\n```\n{{context document=\"xwiki:XWiki.userwithscriptright\" transformationContext=\"document\"}}{{velocity}}Hello from Velocity!{{/velocity}}{{/context}}\n```\n\nwritten by a user not having script right (for example in the user's profile) should produce an error (the user is not allowed to write scripts). However, because of the vulnerability, if the author of the document \"xwiki:XWiki.userwithscriptright\" has script right (but not programming right) the script will be executed with as if it was written by the target user.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in XWiki 14.8RC1, 14.4.5 and 13.10.10.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere's no workaround for this issue.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19856\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [JIRA](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Incorrect Authorization:", "* Execute scripts with the right of another user."]}
