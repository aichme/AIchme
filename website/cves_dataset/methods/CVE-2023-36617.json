{"description": "A ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component before 0.12.2 for Ruby. The URI parser mishandles invalid URLs that have specific characters. There is an increase in execution time for parsing strings to URI objects with `rfc2396_parser.rb` and `rfc3986_parser.rb`.\n\nNOTE: this issue exists becuse of an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-28755. Version 0.10.3 is also a fixed version.\n\n[The Ruby advisory recommends](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2023/06/29/redos-in-uri-CVE-2023-36617/) updating the uri gem to 0.12.2. In order to ensure compatibility with the bundled version in older Ruby series, you may update as follows instead:\n- For Ruby 3.0: Update to uri 0.10.3\n- For Ruby 3.1 and 3.2: Update to uri 0.12.2.\n\nYou can use gem update uri to update it. If you are using bundler, please add gem `uri`, `>= 0.12.2` (or other version mentioned above) to your Gemfile.", "methods": ["The vulnerability was caused by an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-28755.", "The issue exists in the URI component before 0.12.2 for Ruby.", "The vulnerability is a ReDoS issue that mishandles invalid URLs with specific characters.", "The issue causes an increase in execution time for parsing strings to URI objects with `rfc2396_parser.rb` and `rfc3986_parser.rb`."]}
