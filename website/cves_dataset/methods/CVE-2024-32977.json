{"description": "### Impact\n\nOctoPrint versions up until and including 1.10.0 contain a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to completely bypass the authentication **if the `autologinLocal` option is enabled** within `config.yaml`, even if they come from networks that are not configured as `localNetworks`, by spoofing their IP via the `X-Forwarded-For` header.\n\nIf autologin is not enabled, this vulnerability does not have any impact.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in version 1.10.1.\n\n### Workaround\n\nUntil the patch has been applied, OctoPrint administrators who have autologin enabled on their instances should disable it and/or to make the instance inaccessible from potentially hostile networks like the internet.\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Enable the `autologinAs` configuration within the `accessControl` section in the [OctoPrint yaml configuration file](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/config_yaml.html#access-control)\n2. Set your browser to add the `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` header to HTTP requests. For example, this can be done using proxy software like Burp Suite. Alternatively, there are browser extensions such as https://github.com/MisterPhilip/x-forwarded-for, but I haven't tried them.\n3. Navigate to OctoPrint and note that it logs you in automatically.\n\n### Credits\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to OctoPrint by Jacopo Tediosi.", "methods": ["Spoofed IP address via X-Forwarded-For header to bypass authentication.", "Enabled autologinLocal in config.yaml to allow authentication bypass.", "Used HTTP requests with X-Forwarded-For header to exploit vulnerability.", "Added X-Forwarded-For header to HTTP requests using proxy software or browser extensions."]}
