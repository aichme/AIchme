{"description": "### Summary\n\nAn issue in the OpenSearch observability plugins allows unintended access to private tenant resources like notebooks. The system did not properly check if the user was the resource author when accessing resources in a private tenant, leading to potential data being revealed.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe lack of proper access control validation for private tenant resources in the OpenSearch observability and reporting plugins can lead to unintended data access. If an authorized user with observability or reporting roles is aware of another user's private tenant resource ID, such as a notebook, they can potentially read, modify, or take ownership of that resource, despite not being the original author, thus impacting the confidentiality and integrity of private tenant resources. The impact is confined to private tenant resources, where authorized users may gain inappropriate visibility into data intended to be private from other users within the same OpenSearch instance, potentially violating the intended separation of access. This issue does not alter the scope of access but highlights a flaw in the existing access control mechanisms.\n\nImpacted versions <= 2.13\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patches are included in OpenSearch 2.14\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone\n\n### References\n\nOpenSearch 2.14 is available for download at https://opensearch.org/versions/opensearch-2-14-0.html\n\nThe latest version of OpenSearch is available for download at https://opensearch.org/downloads.html", "methods": ["Impersonation of authorized user to access private tenant resources.", "Lack of access control validation for private tenant resources.", "Unauthorized access to private tenant resources.", "Data exposure through unintended access to private tenant resources.", "Bypass of access control mechanisms."]}
