{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe vulnerability occurs in configurations where foreign content is allowed, i.e. either `svg` or `math` are in the list of allowed elements.\nSpecifically, the requirements for the vulnerability are:\n\n1. Allowing one foreign element: `svg`, or `math`\n2. Comments or one raw text element: `iframe`, `noembed`, `xmp`, `title`, `noframes`, `style` or `noscript`\n\nConfigurations that meet the above requirements plus the following are vulnerable to an additional vulnerability:\n\n- Any HTML integration element: `title`, `desc`, `mi`, `mo`, `mn`, `ms`, `mtext`, `annotation-xml`.\n\nIn case an application sanitizes user input with a vulnerable configuration, an attacker could\nbypass the sanitization and inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript code.\n\nNote that in the default configuration the vulnerability is not present.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in versions 8.0.723 and 8.1.722-beta (preview version).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisallow foreign elements `svg` and `math`. This is the case in the default configuration, which is therefore not affected by the vulnerability.\n", "methods": ["Bypassing sanitization to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.", "Injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.", "Exploitation of a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability."]}
