{"description": "When parsing a malformed JSON payload, libprocess in Apache Mesos versions 1.4.0 to 1.5.0 might crash due to an uncaught exception. Parsing chunked HTTP requests with trailers can lead to a libprocess crash too because of the mistakenly planted assertion. A malicious actor can therefore cause a denial of service of Mesos masters rendering the Mesos-controlled cluster inoperable.", "methods": ["Attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) of Mesos masters.", "Exploit a vulnerability in Apache Mesos to crash the service.", "Use a malformed JSON payload to cause a crash.", "Use a malformed HTTP request to cause a crash."]}
