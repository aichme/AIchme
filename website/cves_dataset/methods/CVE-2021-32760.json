{"description": "## Impact\n\nA bug was found in containerd where pulling and extracting a specially-crafted container image can result in Unix file permission changes for existing files in the host\u2019s filesystem.  Changes to file permissions can deny access to the expected owner of the file, widen access to others, or set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and sticky.  This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified, or executed without an additional cooperating process.\n\n## Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8.  Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released.  Running containers do not need to be restarted.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nEnsure you only pull images from trusted sources.\n\nLinux security modules (LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files potentially affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent containerd from interacting with unexpected files.\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at security@containerd.io if you think you\u2019ve found a security bug.", "methods": ["Used a container image with a specially-crafted archive package to change Unix file permissions outside of the unpack target directory.", "Used a container image from an untrusted source.", "Used a Linux security module (LSM) to limit containerd's interaction with unexpected files."]}
