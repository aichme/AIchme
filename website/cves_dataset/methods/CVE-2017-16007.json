{"description": "Affected versions of `node-jose` are vulnerable to an invalid curve attack. This allows an attacker to recover the private secret key when JWE with Key Agreement with Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static (ECDH-ES) is used.\n\n[Proof of Concept](https://gist.github.com/asanso/fa25685348051ef6a28d49aa0f27a4ae)\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.9.3 or later.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in a cryptographic library (node-jose) to recover a private secret key.", "Used an invalid curve attack to compromise the key."]}
