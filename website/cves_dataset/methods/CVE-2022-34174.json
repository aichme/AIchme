{"description": "In Jenkins 2.355 and earlier, LTS 2.332.3 and earlier, an observable timing discrepancy on the login form allows distinguishing between login attempts with an invalid username, and login attempts with a valid username and wrong password, when using the Jenkins user database security realm. This allows attackers to determine the validity of attacker-specified usernames.\n\nLogin attempts with an invalid username now validate a synthetic password to eliminate the timing discrepancy in Jenkins 2.356, LTS 2.332.4.", "methods": ["Uses timing discrepancy to determine username validity.", "Exploits timing difference between invalid and valid username attempts.", "Uses login form to gather information about valid usernames."]}
