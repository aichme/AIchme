{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker could send a JWE containing compressed data that used large amounts of memory and CPU when decompressed by Decrypt or DecryptMulti. Those functions now return an error if the decompressed data would exceed 250kB or 10x the compressed size (whichever is larger). Thanks to Enze Wang@Alioth and Jianjun Chen@Zhongguancun Lab (@zer0yu and @chenjj) for reporting.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem is fixed in the following packages and versions:\n- github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v4 version 4.0.1\n- github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v3 version 3.0.3\n- gopkg.in/go-jose/go-jose.v2 version 2.6.3\n\nThe problem will not be fixed in the following package because the package is archived:\n- gopkg.in/square/go-jose.v2", "methods": ["Used Data Amplification to send a JWE with highly compressed data to cause memory and CPU exhaustion.", "Used Improper Input Validation to bypass checks on decompressed data size."]}
