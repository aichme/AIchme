This is possible because the application injects an attacker-controlled parameter that will be stored in the server and used by the client into an unsanitized DOM element. When chained with CVE-2024-6534, it could result in account takeover.", "methods": ["Injects attacker-controlled parameters into an unsanitized DOM element.", "Executes arbitrary JavaScript on the client."]}
