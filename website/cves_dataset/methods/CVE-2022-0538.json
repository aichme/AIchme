This library is used by Jenkins to serialize and deserialize various XML files, like global and job `config.xml`, `build.xml`, and numerous others.\n\nThis allows attackers able to submit crafted XML files to Jenkins to be parsed as configuration, e.g. through the `POST config.xml` API, to cause a denial of service (DoS).", "methods": ["Used crafted XML files to cause a denial of service (DoS).", "Exploited a vulnerability in the XStream library.", "Submitted crafted XML files through the POST config.xml API."]}
