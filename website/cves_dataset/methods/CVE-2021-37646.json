{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.StringNGrams(\n  data=['',''],\n  data_splits=[0,2],\n  separator=' '*100,\n  ngram_widths=[-80,0,0,-60],\n  left_pad=' ',\n  right_pad=' ',\n  pad_width=100,\n  preserve_short_sequences=False)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L184) calls `reserve` on a `tstring` with a value that sometimes can be negative if user supplies negative `ngram_widths`. The `reserve` method calls `TF_TString_Reserve` which has an `unsigned long` argument for the size of the buffer. Hence, the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c283e542a3f422420cfdb332414543b62fc4e4a5).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Used integer overflow to cause a buffer overflow in memory allocation.", "Used implicit conversion to transform a negative value to a large integer.", "Used a vulnerable implementation of `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams` to exploit the integer overflow issue."]}
