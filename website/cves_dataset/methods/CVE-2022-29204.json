{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of [`tf.raw_ops.UnsortedSegmentJoin`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f3b9bf4c3c0597563b289c0512e98d4ce81f886e/tensorflow/core/kernels/unsorted_segment_join_op.cc#L83-L148) does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.strings.unsorted_segment_join(\n  inputs=['123'],\n  segment_ids=[0],\n  num_segments=-1)\n```\n\nThe code assumes `num_segments` is a positive scalar but there is no validation:\n\n```cc\nconst Tensor& num_segments_tensor = context->input(2);\nauto num_segments = num_segments_tensor.scalar<NUM_SEGMENTS_TYPE>()();\n// ...\nTensor* output_tensor = nullptr;\nTensorShape output_shape =\n    GetOutputShape(input_shape, segment_id_shape, num_segments);\n```\n\nSince this value is used to allocate the output tensor, a negative value would result in a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure), as per [TFSA-2021-198](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-198.md).\n\n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [84563f265f28b3c36a15335c8b005d405260e943](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/84563f265f28b3c36a15335c8b005d405260e943) and GitHub commit [20cb18724b0bf6c09071a3f53434c4eec53cc147](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/20cb18724b0bf6c09071a3f53434c4eec53cc147).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n      \n### For more information \nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n                       \n### Attribution \nThis vulnerability has been reported externally via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/55305).", "methods": ["Trigger a denial of service attack by providing a negative value for the `num_segments` argument in `tf.strings.unsorted_segment_join()`.", "Exploit a missing validation in the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.UnsortedSegmentJoin`."]}
