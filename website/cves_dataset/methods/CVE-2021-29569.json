{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` can cause reads outside of bounds of heap allocated data if attacker supplies specially crafted inputs:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.qint32) \ninput_max = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)\ninput_min = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.float32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.RequantizationRange(input=input, input_min=input_min, input_max=input_max)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/ac328eaa3870491ababc147822cd04e91a790643/tensorflow/core/kernels/requantization_range_op.cc#L49-L50) assumes that the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors have at least one element, as it accesses the first element in two arrays:\n\n```cc\nconst float input_min_float = ctx->input(1).flat<float>()(0);\nconst float input_max_float = ctx->input(2).flat<float>()(0);\n```\n\nIf the tensors are empty, `.flat<T>()` is an empty object, backed by an empty array. Hence, accesing even the 0th element is a read outside the bounds.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ef0c008ee84bad91ec6725ddc42091e19a30cf0e](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ef0c008ee84bad91ec6725ddc42091e19a30cf0e).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Heap out of bounds read in `RequantizationRange` implementation.", "Reads outside of bounds of heap allocated data.", "Accessing elements outside the bounds of an empty array."]}
