{"description": "### Impact\nThe `trainBatch` function has a command injection vulnerability. Clients of the Limdu library are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code that contains a vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in version 0.9.5.\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not use trainBatch with classifiers that rely on shell execution, such as SVM Perf, SVM Linear or Adaboost\n\n### References\nNo", "methods": ["Command injection in a library function.", "Used malicious files with Microsoft Office documents and PDFs.", "Used PowerShell commands to execute payloads.", "Used direct Windows system calls by leveraging Dumpert.", "Used malicious DLLs to setup persistence in the Registry Key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current Version\\Run."]}
