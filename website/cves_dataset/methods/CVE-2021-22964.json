{"description": "### Impact\n\nA redirect vulnerability in the `fastify-static` module allows remote attackers to redirect Mozilla Firefox users to arbitrary websites via a double slash `//` followed by a domain: `http://localhost:3000//a//youtube.com/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e`.\n\nA DOS vulnerability is possible if the URL contains invalid characters `curl --path-as-is \"http://localhost:3000//^/..\"`\n\nThe issue shows up on all the `fastify-static` applications that set `redirect: true` option. By default, it is `false`.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched in `fastify-static@4.4.1`\n\n### Workarounds\nIf updating is not an option, you can sanitize the input URLs using the [`rewriteUrl`](https://www.fastify.io/docs/latest/Server/#rewriteurl) server option.\n\n### References\n\n+ Bug founder: drstrnegth\n+ [hackerone Report](https://hackerone.com/reports/1361804)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [fastify-static](https://github.com/fastify/fastify-static)\n* Contact the [security team](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/blob/main/SECURITY.md#the-fastify-security-team)\n", "methods": ["Used a redirect vulnerability in the `fastify-static` module to redirect Mozilla Firefox users to arbitrary websites via a double slash `//` followed by a domain.", "Used a DOS vulnerability by sending a URL with invalid characters `curl --path-as-is \"http://localhost:3000//^/..\"`.", "Used user input to exploit the redirect vulnerability.", "Used the `rewriteUrl` server option to sanitize input URLs as a workaround."]}
