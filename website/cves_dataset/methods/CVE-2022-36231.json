An attacker using a specially crafted payload may execute OS commands by using command chaining because during object initalization there is no validation performed and the user provided path is used.", "methods": ["Command and Control: Command and Control infrastructure is not explicitly mentioned, but the use of a specially crafted payload to execute OS commands suggests a potential C2 channel.", "Command and Control: The use of a specially crafted payload to execute OS commands implies a C2 channel for delivering payloads.", "Command and Control: The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute OS commands, which could be used to establish a C2 channel.", "Command Injection: The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute OS commands by using command chaining.", "Command Injection: The lack of validation on the user-provided path allows an attacker to inject commands."]}
