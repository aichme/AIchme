{"description": "Jenkins Node and Label parameter Plugin 1.10.3 and earlier does not escape the name and description of Node and Label parameters on views displaying parameters, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the \\\"Build With Parameters\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities of this kind on the \\\"Build With Parameters\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the [SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions) fix.", "methods": ["Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in Jenkins Node and Label parameter Plugin.", "Exploitation of stored XSS vulnerability.", "Use of Item/Configure permission to exploit vulnerability.", "Use of Build With Parameters and Parameters pages to exploit vulnerability.", "Use of unhardened pages to exploit vulnerability.", "Use of stored XSS to inject malicious scripts."]}
