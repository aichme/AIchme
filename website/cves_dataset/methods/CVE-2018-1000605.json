{"description": "A man in the middle vulnerability exists in Jenkins CollabNet Plugin 2.0.4 and earlier in CollabNetApp.java, CollabNetPlugin.java, CNFormFieldValidator.java that allows attackers to impersonate any service that Jenkins connects to. CollabNet Plugin 2.0.5 and newer no longer does that. It instead requires users to opt in to disabling SSL/TLS certificate validation by setting the system property hudson.plugins.collabnet.CollabNetPlugin.skipSslValidation to true. This feature applies to connections by this plugin only.", "methods": ["Impersonation of a service that Jenkins connects to.", "Disabling SSL/TLS certificate validation."]}
