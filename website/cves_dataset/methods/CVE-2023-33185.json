{"description": "The django_ses library implements a mail backend for Django using AWS Simple Email Service. The library exports the `SESEventWebhookView class` intended to receive signed requests from AWS to handle email bounces, subscriptions, etc. These requests are signed by AWS and are verified by django_ses, however the verification of this signature was found to be flawed as it allowed users to specify arbitrary public certificates.", "methods": ["Used a flawed signature verification mechanism in a library (django-ses) to allow arbitrary public certificates.", "Implemented a vulnerable library (django-ses) that could be exploited for malicious purposes."]}
