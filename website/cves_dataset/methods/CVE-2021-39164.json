{"description": "### Impact\nUnauthorised users can access the membership (list of members, with their display names) of a room if they know the ID of the room. The vulnerability is limited to rooms with `shared` history visibility. Furthermore, the unauthorised user must be using an account on a vulnerable homeserver that is in the room.\n\n### Patches\nServer administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nAdministrators of servers that use a reverse proxy could, with potentially unacceptable loss of functionality, block the following endpoints:\n* `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter\n* `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter\n\n### References\nn/a\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at security@matrix.org.", "methods": ["Used a web application vulnerability to disclose sensitive information (room membership).", "Used a web application vulnerability to access sensitive information without authorization.", "Used a web application vulnerability to access sensitive information via a specific endpoint (_/matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members).", "Used a web application vulnerability to access sensitive information via a specific endpoint (_/matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members).", "Used a web application vulnerability to access sensitive information via a query parameter (at)."]}
