{"description": "A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in aimhubio/aim version 3.19.3. The vulnerability arises from the improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically in the logs-tab for runs. The terminal output logs are displayed using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` function in React, which is susceptible to XSS attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious scripts into the logs, which will be executed when a user views the logs-tab.", "methods": ["Injected malicious scripts into the logs-tab for execution when a user views the logs-tab.", "Exploited a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the logs-tab for runs.", "Used the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` function in React to inject malicious scripts."]}
