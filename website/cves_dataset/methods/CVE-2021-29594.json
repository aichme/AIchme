{"description": "### Impact\nTFLite's [convolution code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/09c73bca7d648e961dd05898292d91a8322a9d45/tensorflow/lite/kernels/conv.cc) has multiple division where the divisor is controlled by the user and not checked to be non-zero. For example:\n\n```cc \nconst int input_size = NumElements(input) / SizeOfDimension(input, 0);\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ff489d95a9006be080ad14feb378f2b4dac35552](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ff489d95a9006be080ad14feb378f2b4dac35552).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Division by zero in user-controlled input in TFLite's convolution code."]}
