{"description": "An extension point in Jenkins allows selectively disabling cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for specific URLs.\n\nImplementations of that extension point received a different representation of the URL path than the Stapler web framework uses to dispatch requests in Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier. This discrepancy allowed attackers to craft URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL.\n\nJenkins now uses the same representation of the URL path to decide whether CSRF protection is needed for a given URL as the Stapler web framework uses.\n\nIn case of problems, administrators can disable this security fix by setting the system property `hudson.security.csrf.CrumbFilter.UNPROCESSED_PATHINFO` to `true`.\n\nAs an additional safeguard, semicolon (`;`) characters in the path part of a URL are now banned by default. Administrators can disable this protection by setting the system property `jenkins.security.SuspiciousRequestFilter.allowSemicolonsInPath` to `true`.", "methods": ["Implemented a vulnerability in Jenkins to bypass CSRF protection for specific URLs.", "Crafted URLs to exploit the discrepancy between Jenkins and Stapler web framework URL representations.", "Used a system property to disable the security fix for CSRF protection.", "Used a system property to disable protection against semicolon characters in URL paths."]}
