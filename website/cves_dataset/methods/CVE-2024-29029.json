In memos 0.13.2, an SSRF vulnerability exists at the `/o/get/image` that allows unauthenticated users to enumerate the internal network and retrieve images. The response from the image request is then copied into the response of the current server request, causing a reflected XSS vulnerability. Version 0.22.0 of memos removes the vulnerable file.", "methods": ["Used Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to enumerate internal network.", "Used Cross-site Scripting (XSS) to inject malicious code.", "Used SSRF to retrieve internal images.", "Used SSRF to copy response into current server request."]}
