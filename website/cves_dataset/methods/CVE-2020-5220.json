{"description": "### Impact\n\nResourceBundle accepts and uses any serialisation groups to be passed via a HTTP header. This might lead to data exposure by using an unintended serialisation group - for example it could make Shop API use a more permissive group from Admin API.\n\nAnyone exposing an API with ResourceBundle's controller is affected. The vulnerable versions are: `<1.3 || >=1.3.0 <=1.3.12 || >=1.4.0 <=1.4.5 || >=1.5.0 <=1.5.0 || >=1.6.0 <=1.6.2`.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe patch is provided for ResourceBundle 1.3.13, 1.4.6, 1.5.1 and 1.6.3, but not for any versions below 1.3.\n\nAfter it is applied, It allows to choose only the groups that are defined in `serialization_groups` or `allowed_serialization_groups` route definition. Any group not defined in those will not be used.\n\nThis behaviour might be a BC break for those using custom groups via the HTTP header, please adjust `allowed_serialization_groups` accordingly.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nService `sylius.resource_controller.request_configuration_factory` can be overridden with an implementation copied from `\\Sylius\\Bundle\\ResourceBundle\\Controller\\RequestConfigurationFactory` where the part that handles custom serialisation groups is deleted.", "methods": ["Used unintended serialization to expose data.", "Exposed data by using a more permissive group from Admin API.", "Used HTTP headers to pass serialization groups.", "Used a vulnerable version of ResourceBundle (CVE-affected versions: <1.3, >=1.3.0 <=1.3.12, >=1.4.0 <=1.4.5, >=1.5.0 <=1.5.0, >=1.6.0 <=1.6.2)."]}
