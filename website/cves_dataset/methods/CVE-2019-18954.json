{"description": "Pomelo v2.2.5 allows external control of critical state data. A malicious user input can corrupt arbitrary methods and attributes in `template/game-server/app/servers/connector/handler/entryHandler.js` because certain internal attributes can be overwritten via a conflicting name. Hence, a malicious attacker can manipulate internal attributes by adding additional attributes to user input.", "methods": ["Manipulated user input to corrupt arbitrary methods and attributes.", "Manipulated internal attributes by adding additional attributes to user input.", "External control of critical state data."]}
