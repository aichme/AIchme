A malicious actor can use this vulnerability to access files outside of the intended directory root, which may result in the disclosure of private files on the vulnerable system.\n\n**Example request:**\n```http\nGET /../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nhost:foo\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to v0.10.1 or later.", "methods": ["Used directory traversal to access files outside of the intended directory root.", "Disclosed private files on the vulnerable system."]}
