One exploitable scenario requires having the system extension ext:lowlevel (Backend Module: DB Check) installed, with a valid backend user who has administrator privileges. The other exploitable scenario requires having the system extension ext:sys_action installed, with a valid backend user who has limited privileges.", "methods": ["Insecure deserialization of classes QueryGenerator and QueryView.", "Exploitation of system extension ext:lowlevel (Backend Module: DB Check) with administrator privileges.", "Exploitation of system extension ext:sys_action with limited privileges."]}
