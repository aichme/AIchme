{"description": "The Easy!Appointments API authorization is checked against the user's existence, without validating the permissions. As a result, a low privileged user (eg. provider) can create a new admin user via the \"/api/v1/admins/\" endpoint and take over the system. A [patch](https://github.com/alextselegidis/easyappointments/commit/63dbb51decfcc1631c398ecd6d30e3a337845526) is available on the `develop` branch of the repository.", "methods": ["Created a new admin user via the \"/api/v1/admins/\" endpoint.", "Escalated privileges to take over the system.", "Used a patch to fix the vulnerability."]}
