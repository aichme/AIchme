{"description": "### Impact\nThe `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` implementation has incomplete validation of the shapes of its arguments:\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0e68f4d3295eb0281a517c3662f6698992b7b2cf/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_fill_empty_rows_op.cc#L235-L241\n\nAlthough `reverse_index_map_t` and `grad_values_t` are accessed in a similar pattern, only `reverse_index_map_t` is validated to be of proper shape. Hence, malicious users can pass a bad `grad_values_t` to trigger an assertion failure in `vec`, causing denial of service in serving installations.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in 390611e0d45c5793c7066110af37c8514e6a6c54 and will release a patch release for all affected versions.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability is a variant of [GHSA-63xm-rx5p-xvqr](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-63xm-rx5p-xvqr)", "methods": ["Incomplete validation of input shapes in the `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` implementation.", "Triggering an assertion failure in `vec` to cause denial of service."]}
