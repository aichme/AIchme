{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.python.ops import gen_string_ops\n\ngen_string_ops.unicode_encode(\n  input_values=[],\n  input_splits=[],\n  output_encoding='UTF-8',\n  errors='ignore',\n  replacement_char='a')\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/unicode_ops.cc#L533-L539) reads the first dimension of the `input_splits` tensor before validating that this tensor is not empty: \n\n```cc\n  const Tensor& input_splits = context->input(1);\n  const auto input_splits_flat = input_splits.flat<SPLITS_TYPE>();\n  TensorShape output_shape({input_splits.dim_size(0) - 1});\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [2e0ee46f1a47675152d3d865797a18358881d7a6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/2e0ee46f1a47675152d3d865797a18358881d7a6).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Reference to nullptr in unicode encoding.", "Use of undefined behavior.", "Use of unvalidated input in implementation.", "Use of unvalidated tensor in `input_splits` variable.", "Use of unvalidated dimension in `input_splits.dim_size(0)`."]}
