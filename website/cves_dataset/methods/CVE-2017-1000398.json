{"description": "The remote API in Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier at /computer/(agent-name)/api showed information about tasks (typically builds) currently running on that agent. This included information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API now only shows information about accessible tasks.", "methods": ["Exposed sensitive information to an unauthorized actor through a remote API.", "Lacked proper access control, allowing users to view tasks they shouldn't have access to.", "Exposed information about tasks, including builds, to unauthorized users."]}
