{"description": "The Phoenix team designed `Phoenix.Controller.redirect/2` to protect against redirects allowing user input to redirect to an external URL where your application code otherwise assumes a local path redirect. This is why the `:to` option is used for \u201clocal\u201d URL redirects and why you must pass the `:external` option to intentionally allow external URLs to be redirected to. It has been disclosed that carefully crafted user input may be treated by some browsers as an external URL. An attacker can use this vulnerability to aid in social engineering attacks. The most common use would be to create highly believable phishing attacks. For example, the following user input would pass local URL validation, but be treated by Chrome and Firefox as external URLs: \n`http://localhost:4000/?redirect=/\\nexample.com`\nNot all browsers are affected, but latest Chrome and Firefox will issue a get request for `example.com` and successfully redirect externally", "methods": ["Used user input to redirect to an external URL.", "Conducted social engineering attacks via phishing.", "Utilized a vulnerability to aid in redirecting to external URLs.", "Created highly believable phishing attacks.", "Issued a GET request to an external URL."]}
