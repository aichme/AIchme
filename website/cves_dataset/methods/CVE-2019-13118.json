Nokogiri 1.10.5 updated libxslt to version 1.1.34 to address this and other vulnerabilities in libxslt.", "methods": ["Exploited a type confusion vulnerability in a library (libxslt).", "Used a vulnerable version of a library (libxslt 1.1.33).", "Updated a library to a fixed version (libxslt 1.1.34).", "Patched a vulnerability in a library (libxslt)."]}
