{"description": "### Impact\n\nWhen a authentificated request is made to `POST /store-api/account/logout`, the cart will be cleared, but the User won't be logged out. This affects only the direct store-api usage, as the PHP Storefront listens additionally on `CustomerLogoutEvent` and invalidates the session additionally. \n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed with Shopware 6.6.1.0 and 6.5.8.8.\n\n### Workarounds\nWhen you are not able to update, you can install the latest version of the Shopware Security Plugin.\n", "methods": ["Exploited improper session handling in Shopware store-api account logout functionality.", "Failed to properly log out authenticated users.", "Used a vulnerability in the store-api to maintain unauthorized access."]}
