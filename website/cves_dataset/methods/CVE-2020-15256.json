{"description": "### Impact\nA prototype pollution vulnerability has been found in `object-path` <= 0.11.4 affecting the `set()` method. The vulnerability is limited to the `includeInheritedProps` mode (if version >= 0.11.0 is used), which has to be explicitly enabled by creating a new instance of `object-path` and setting the option `includeInheritedProps: true`, or by using the default `withInheritedProps` instance. The default operating mode is not affected by the vulnerability if version >= 0.11.0 is used. Any usage of `set()` in versions < 0.11.0 is vulnerable.\n \n### Patches\nUpgrade to version >= 0.11.5\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use the `includeInheritedProps: true` options or the `withInheritedProps` instance if using a version >= 0.11.0.\n\n### References\n[Read more about the prototype pollution vulnerability](https://codeburst.io/what-is-prototype-pollution-49482fc4b638)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [object-path](https://github.com/mariocasciaro/object-path)", "methods": ["Manipulation of object properties to inject malicious data.", "Exploitation of a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `set()` method."]}
