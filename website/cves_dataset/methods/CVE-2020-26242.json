{"description": "### Impact\nDenial-of-service (crash) during block processing\n\n### Details\n\nAffected versions suffer from a vulnerability which can be exploited through the `MULMOD` operation, by specifying a modulo of `0`: `mulmod(a,b,0)`, causing a `panic` in the underlying library. \nThe crash was in the `uint256` library, where a buffer [underflowed](https://github.com/holiman/uint256/blob/4ce82e695c10ddad57215bdbeafb68b8c5df2c30/uint256.go#L442).\n\n\tif `d == 0`, `dLen` remains `0`\n\nand https://github.com/holiman/uint256/blob/4ce82e695c10ddad57215bdbeafb68b8c5df2c30/uint256.go#L451 will try to access index `[-1]`.\n\nThe `uint256` library was first merged in this [commit](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/cf6674539c589f80031f3371a71c6a80addbe454), on 2020-06-08. \nExploiting this vulnerabilty would cause all vulnerable nodes to drop off the network. \n\nThe issue was brought to our attention through a [bug report](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/21367), showing a `panic` occurring on sync from genesis on the Ropsten network.\n \nIt was estimated that the least obvious way to fix this would be to merge the fix into `uint256`, make a new release of that library and then update the geth-dependency.\n\n- https://github.com/holiman/uint256/releases/tag/v1.1.1 was made the same day, \n- PR to address the issue: https://github.com/holiman/uint256/pull/80 \n- PR to update geth deps: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/21368 \n\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to v1.9.18 or higher\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)\n* Email us at [security@ethereum.org](mailto:security@ethereum.org)", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in the `MULMOD` operation by specifying a modulo of `0` to cause a `panic` in the `uint256` library.", "Triggered a buffer underflow in the `uint256` library by accessing an index `[-1]`.", "Caused a denial-of-service (crash) during block processing."]}
