{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt is possible to bypass the existing security measures put in place to avoid open redirect by using a redirect such as `//mydomain.com` (i.e. omitting the `http:`). It was also possible to bypass it when using URL such as `http:/mydomain.com`.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched on XWiki 13.10.10, 14.4.4 and 14.8RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only way to workaround the bug is by providing a patched jar of xwiki-platform-oldcore containing the following changes: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e4f7f68e93cb08c25632c126356d218abf192d1e#diff-c445f288d5d63424f56ef13f65514ab4e174a72e979b53b88197c2b7def267cf.\n\n### References\n\n  * Jira ticket of the reported vulnerability: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19994\n  * Jira ticket of the original mechanism put in place to prevent open redirect: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-10309\n  * Original advisory about open redirect: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-jp55-vvmf-63mv\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [Security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Bypassed security measures to perform open redirect.", "Used URL manipulation to bypass security measures.", "Utilized a redirect with a missing protocol (e.g. `//mydomain.com`).", "Utilized a URL with a missing protocol (e.g. `http:/mydomain.com`)."]}
