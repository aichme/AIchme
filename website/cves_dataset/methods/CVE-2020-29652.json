{"description": "A nil pointer dereference in the golang.org/x/crypto/ssh component through v0.0.0-20201203163018-be400aefbc4c for Go allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service against SSH servers. An attacker can craft an authentication request message for the `gssapi-with-mic` method which will cause NewServerConn to panic via a nil pointer dereference if ServerConfig.GSSAPIWithMICConfig is nil.", "methods": ["Attempted to cause a denial of service (DoS) against SSH servers.", "Exploited a nil pointer dereference vulnerability in the golang.org/x/crypto/ssh component."]}
