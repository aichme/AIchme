{"description": "The extension allows by default to upload SVG files when a logged in frontend user uploads a new profile image. This may lead to Cross-Site Scripting, when the uploaded SVG image is used as is on the website.\n\nNote: If SVG uploads are required, it is recommended to use the TYPO3 extension svg_sanitizer (added to TYPO3 core since versions 9.5.28, 10.4.18 and 11.3.0) to prevent upload of malicious SVG files or to set up a strict Content Security Policy for the destination folder of uploaded images.", "methods": ["Used Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to inject malicious code via SVG file uploads.", "Used the TYPO3 extension femanager to upload malicious SVG files.", "Failed to sanitize uploaded SVG files, allowing malicious code execution.", "Failed to implement a Content Security Policy to restrict malicious file uploads."]}
