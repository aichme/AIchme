{"description": "### Overview\n\nAffected versions have no limit to using unsafe-accessor. Can be ignored if `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` not setup\n\n### Details\n\nIf UA was loaded as a named module, the internal data of UA will be protected by JVM and others can only access UA via UA's standard api.\nMain application can setup `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit accesses to UA.\nUntrusted code can access UA without lmitation in affected versions even UA was loaded as a named module.\n\n### References\n\n[The commit to fix](https://github.com/Karlatemp/UnsafeAccessor/commit/4ef83000184e8f13239a1ea2847ee401d81585fd)\n\n", "methods": ["Loaded a Java library (UnsafeAccessor) without security checks.", "Loaded a Java library (UnsafeAccessor) as a named module, but still accessible via its standard API.", "Loaded a Java library (UnsafeAccessor) without access limitation, allowing untrusted code to access it."]}
