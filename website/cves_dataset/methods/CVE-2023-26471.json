{"description": "### Impact\n\nComments are supposed to be executed with the right of superadmin but in restricted mode (anything dangerous is disabled) but the async macro is not taking into account the restricted mode.\n\nThis means that any user with comment right can use the async macro to make it execute any wiki content with the right of superadmin as in:\n\n{{async}}\n{{groovy}}println \"it works !\"{{/groovy}}\n{{/async}}\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only known workaround consists in applying [the following patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/00532d9f1404287cf3ec3a05056640d809516006) and rebuilding and redeploying `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-rendering-async-macro`.\n\n### References\n\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20234\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira](http://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [Security ML](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Used XWiki Platform to execute arbitrary code with superadmin rights through comments and async macro.", "Executed arbitrary code with superadmin rights through async macro, bypassing restricted mode.", "Used async macro to execute wiki content with superadmin rights.", "Used Groovy code to execute arbitrary commands.", "Used comments to execute arbitrary code with superadmin rights."]}
