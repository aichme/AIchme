{"description": "### Impact\nflask-session-captcha is a package which allows users to extend Flask by adding an image based captcha stored in a server side session.\n\nThe `captcha.validate()` function would return `None` if passed no value (e.g. by submitting a request with an empty form).\n\nIf implementing users were checking the return value to be **False**, the captcha verification check could be bypassed.\n\nSample vulnerable code:\n```python\nif captcha.validate() == False:\n    ... # abort\nelse:\n   ... # do stuff\n```\n\n### Patches\nA new version (1.2.1) is available that fixes the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can workaround the issue by not explicitly checking that the value is False. \n\nChecking the return value less explicitly should still work. \n\n```python\nif not captcha.validate():\n    ... # abort\nelse:\n   ... # do stuff\n```\n\n```python\nif captcha.validate():\n    ... # do stuff\nelse:\n   ... # abort\n```\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/Tethik/flask-session-captcha/pull/27\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the github repo](https://github.com/Tethik/flask-session-captcha)\n", "methods": ["Bypassing security controls by exploiting a logic flaw in the captcha validation function.", "Using a vulnerable library (flask-session-captcha) to bypass security controls.", "Exploiting a logic flaw in the captcha validation function to gain unauthorized access."]}
