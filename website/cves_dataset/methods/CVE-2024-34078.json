{"description": "### Impact\n\nIf using `keep_typographic_whitespace=False` (which is the default), the sanitizer normalizes unicode to the NFKC form at the end. Some unicode characters normalize to chevrons; this allows specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in 2.4.2.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSet `keep_typographic_whitespace=True` explicitly, or normalize to NFKC yourself earlier.\n", "methods": ["Used Unicode normalization to bypass HTML sanitization.", "Used specially crafted HTML to escape sanitization.", "Used default configuration settings to enable Unicode normalization.", "Used a workaround to prevent Unicode normalization (set `keep_typographic_whitespace=True`)."]}
