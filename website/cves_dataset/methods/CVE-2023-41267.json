{"description": "In the Apache Airflow HDFS Provider, versions prior to 4.1.1, a documentation\u00a0info pointed users to an install incorrect pip package. As this package name was unclaimed, in theory, an attacker could claim this package and provide code that would be executed when this package was installed. The Airflow team has since taken ownership of the package (neutralizing the risk), and fixed the doc strings in version 4.1.1\n", "methods": ["Claimed an unclaimed package to execute malicious code when installed.", "Provided incorrect installation instructions for a package."]}
