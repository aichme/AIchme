{"description": "Older versions of the package are vulnerable to Command Injection as an attacker controlled parameter. As a result, attackers may run malicious commands.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nconst find = require(\"find-exec\");\nfind(\"mplayer; touch hacked\")\n```\n\nThis creates a file named \"hacked\" on the filesystem.\n\nYou should never allow users to control commands to find, since this package attempts to run every command provided.\n\nThanks to @miguelafmonteiro for reporting.", "methods": ["Command Injection via user-controlled parameter in the find-exec package.", "Execution of malicious commands on the filesystem."]}
