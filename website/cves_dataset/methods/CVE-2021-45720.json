{"description": "Lru crate has two functions for getting an iterator. Both iterators give references to key and value. Calling specific functions, like pop(), will remove and free the value, and but it's still possible to access the reference of value which is already dropped causing use after free.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the Lru crate to cause a Use After Free condition."]}
