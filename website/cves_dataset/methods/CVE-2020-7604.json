This function uses the variable &quot;filename&quot; to construct the argument of the exec call without any sanitization. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker will need to create a new file with the same name as the attack command.", "methods": ["Executed arbitrary commands via OS Command Injection.", "Constructed command arguments without sanitization.", "Created a new file to execute a command."]}
