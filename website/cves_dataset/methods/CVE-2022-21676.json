{"description": "### Impact\n\nA specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process.\n\n> RangeError: Invalid WebSocket frame: RSV2 and RSV3 must be clear\n>   at Receiver.getInfo (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:176:14)\n>   at Receiver.startLoop (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:136:22)\n>   at Receiver._write (/.../node_modules/ws/lib/receiver.js:83:10)\n>   at writeOrBuffer (internal/streams/writable.js:358:12)\n\nThis impacts all the users of the [`engine.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/engine.io) package starting from version `4.0.0`, including those who uses depending packages like [`socket.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io).\n\n### Patches\n\nA fix has been released for each major branch:\n\n| Version range | Fixed version |\n| --- | --- |\n| `engine.io@4.x.x` | `4.1.2` |\n| `engine.io@5.x.x` | `5.2.1` |\n| `engine.io@6.x.x` | `6.1.1` |\n\nPrevious versions (`< 4.0.0`) are not impacted.\n\nFor `socket.io` users:\n\n| Version range | `engine.io` version | Needs minor update? |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `socket.io@4.4.x` | `~6.1.0` | -\n| `socket.io@4.3.x` | `~6.0.0` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@4.4.x`\n| `socket.io@4.2.x` | `~5.2.0` | -\n| `socket.io@4.1.x` | `~5.1.1` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@4.4.x`\n| `socket.io@4.0.x` | `~5.0.0` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@4.4.x`\n| `socket.io@3.1.x` | `~4.1.0` | -\n| `socket.io@3.0.x` | `~4.0.0` | Please upgrade to `socket.io@3.1.x` or `socket.io@4.4.x` (see [here](https://socket.io/docs/v4/migrating-from-3-x-to-4-0/))\n\nIn most cases, running `npm audit fix` should be sufficient. You can also use  `npm update engine.io --depth=9999`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [`engine.io`](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io)\n\nThanks to Marcus Wejderot from Mevisio for the responsible disclosure.\n", "methods": ["Triggered an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the `engine.io` package, specifically in versions 4.0.0 and above.", "Used a malicious HTTP request to crash the Node.js process.", "Exploited a bug in the `ws` library used by `engine.io`.", "Required users to upgrade to a safe version of `engine.io` or `socket.io` to mitigate the vulnerability."]}
