{"description": "An information exposure flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates allows an external user to discover the internal IP or hostname. An attacker could exploit this by checking the `www_authenticate_uri parameter` (which is visible to all end users) in configuration files. This would give sensitive information which may aid in additional system exploitation. A patch is available on the `master` branch and anticipated to be part of version 11.6.1.", "methods": ["Exposed sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.", "Used information disclosure to gather sensitive information.", "Exploited a flaw in openstack-tripleo-heat-templates."]}
