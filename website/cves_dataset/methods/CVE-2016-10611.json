{"description": "Affected versions of `strider-sauce` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `strider-sauce`.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nWhile the package author has created a patch for this vulnerability, they have not yet published it to npm or bumped the version number.\n\nIn order to resolve the vulnerability, you will need to install the module manually from github:\n```\nnpm install github:Strider-CD/strider-sauce#5ff6d65\n```\n\nAs this vulnerability does not have a version bump included with the patch, it is possible that you have received a report for a vulnerable package, yet have installed the patched version and are no longer vulnerable. If that is the case, this advisory can be disregarded.", "methods": ["Downloads executable over unencrypted HTTP connection.", "Allows for interception and replacement of executable by an attacker with a privileged network position.", "Allows for code execution on the system running `strider-sauce`."]}
