This has been fixed in 1.2.1.\n\n### Releases\nThe 1.2.1 gem including the patch has already been released.\nAll past released versions are affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nApplication developers who can't update the gem can workaround by overriding the `PARAM_KEY_EXCEPT_LIST` constant.\n\n```ruby\nmodule Kaminari::Helpers\n  PARAM_KEY_EXCEPT_LIST = [:authenticity_token, :commit, :utf8, :_method, :script_name, :original_script_name].freeze\nend\n```\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Daniel Mircea for finding the issue and sending a patch via GitHub. Also thanks to Aditya Prakash for reporting the vulnerability.", "methods": ["Injected arbitrary code into pages with pagination links.", "Used a vulnerability in Kaminari to inject code.", "Used a GitHub patch to fix the vulnerability.", "Used a workaround by overriding the `PARAM_KEY_EXCEPT_LIST` constant."]}
