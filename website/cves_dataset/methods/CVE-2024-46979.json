{"description": "### Impact\n\nIt's possible to get access to notification filters of any user by using a URL such as `<hostname>xwiki/bin/get/XWiki/Notifications/Code/NotificationFilterPreferenceLivetableResults?outputSyntax=plain&type=custom&user=<username>`. This vulnerability impacts all versions of XWiki since 13.2-rc-1.\nThe filters do not provide much information (they mainly contain references which are public data in XWiki), though some info could be used in combination with other vulnerabilities.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.21, 15.5.5, 15.10.1, 16.0RC1. \nThe patch consists in checking the rights of the user when sending the data.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt's possible to workaround the vulnerability by applying manually the patch: it's possible for an administrator to edit directly the document `XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationFilterPreferenceLivetableResults` to apply the same changes as in the patch. See c8c6545f9bde6f5aade994aa5b5903a67b5c2582.\n\n### References\n\n  * Jira ticket: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20336\n  * Commit: c8c6545f9bde6f5aade994aa5b5903a67b5c2582\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n\n### Attribution\n\nThis vulnerability has been reported on Intigriti by [Mete](https://www.linkedin.com/in/metehan-kalkan-5a3201199).", "methods": ["Leaks data of notification filters of users via a URL.", "Impacts all versions of XWiki since 13.2-rc-1.", "Patched in XWiki 14.10.21, 15.5.5, 15.10.1, 16.0RC1.", "Patch consists of checking user rights when sending data.", "Can be worked around by manually applying the patch."]}
