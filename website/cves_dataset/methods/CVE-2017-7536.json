{"description": "In Hibernate Validator 5.2.x before 5.2.5.Final, 5.3.x before 5.3.6.Final, and 5.4.x before 5.4.2.Final, it was found that when the security manager's reflective permissions, which allows it to access the private members of the class, are granted to Hibernate Validator, a potential privilege escalation can occur. By allowing the calling code to access those private members without the permission an attacker may be able to validate an invalid instance and access the private member value via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue().", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in Hibernate Validator to access private members of a class.", "Used reflective permissions to access private members of a class.", "Accessed private member values via ConstraintViolation#getInvalidValue()."]}
