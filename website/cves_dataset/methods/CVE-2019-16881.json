{"description": "Affected versions of this crate is not panic safe within callback functions stream_callback and stream_finished_callback. The call to user-provided closure might panic before a mem::forget call, which then causes a use after free that grants attacker to control the callback function pointer. This allows an attacker to construct an arbitrary code execution .", "methods": ["Uses a vulnerability in the portaudio-rs crate to execute arbitrary code.", "Uses a use-after-free vulnerability to control the callback function pointer."]}
