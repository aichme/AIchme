{"description": "### Summary\n\nThe maintainer been contemplating whether FTP or other protocols could serve as useful functionalities, but there may not be a practical reason for it since we are utilizing headless Chrome to capture screenshots. The argument is based on the assumption that this package can function as a service.\n\nThe package includes an `ALLOW_LIST` where the host can specify which services the user is permitted to capture screenshots of. By default, capturing screenshots of web services running on localhost, 127.0.0.1, or the [::] is allowed.\n\nThe maintainer is of the opinion that the package should also have a blacklist due to a potential vulnerability (or rather design oversight). If someone hosts this on a server, users could then capture screenshots of other web services running locally.\n\nUnless this is strictly for web pages. Something similar here: https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/issues/235 (localhost is intended for end users or hosts to deny, and the package is for HTTP/HTTPS.)\n\nThis is marked as a `LOW` since the maintainer is not sure if this is a vulnerability, but it's still best to highlight it. :) \n\n### PoC\n\nHave a service like so running locally:\n\n```js\nconst http = require(\"http\")\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n  console.log(\"Received headers:\", req.headers)\n  res.writeHead(200, { \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\" })\n  res.end(\"Something private! But Hello from Server 2 :)\")\n})\n\nserver.listen(3001, () => {\n  console.log(\"Server two running on http://localhost:3001\")\n})\n```\n\nRun the package in dev mode, `pnpm dev`. Feed these URLs:\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3089/?url=http://[::]:3001&width=4000\nhttp://localhost:3089/?url=http://localhost:3001&width=4000\nhttp://localhost:3089/?url=http://127.0.01:3001&width=4000\n```\n\n<img width=\"622\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/jasonraimondi/url-to-png/assets/42532003/21f1c883-ba00-4a15-83b8-922484fa4c2b\">\n\n\n\n### Impact\nDisclose internal web services?\n", "methods": ["Used a web service to capture screenshots of localhost web services (unauthenticated pages).", "Utilized headless Chrome to capture screenshots.", "Implemented an ALLOW_LIST to specify allowed services for screenshot capture.", "Considered implementing a BLACKLIST to block unauthorized services.", "Demonstrated a proof-of-concept (PoC) to capture screenshots of internal web services.", "Used HTTP protocol to serve a web service on localhost.", "Utilized JavaScript to create a web server on localhost.", "Used the `http` module to create a web server.", "Used the `pnpm dev` command to run the package in dev mode.", "Used the `http://localhost:3089/?url=http://[::]:3001&width=4000` URL to capture a screenshot of a web service on localhost."]}
