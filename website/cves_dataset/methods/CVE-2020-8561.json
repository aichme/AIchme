If that user can view kube-apiserver logs when the log level is set to 10, they can view the redirected responses and headers in the logs.", "methods": ["Manipulated Kubernetes API server requests to redirect to private networks.", "Viewed kube-apiserver logs to obtain sensitive information.", "Exploited log level settings to access additional information."]}
