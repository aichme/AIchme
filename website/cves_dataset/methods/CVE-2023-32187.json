{"description": "### Impact\n\nAn issue was found in K3s where an attacker with network access to K3s servers' apiserver/supervisor port (TCP 6443) can force the TLS server to add entries to the certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) list, through a stuffing attack, until the certificate grows so large that it exceeds the maximum size allowed by TLS client implementations. OpenSSL for example will raise an `excessive message size` error when this occurs. No authentication is necessary to perform this attack, only the ability to perform a TLS handshake against the apiserver/supervisor port (TCP 6443).\n\nAffected servers will continue to operate, but clients (including both external administrative access with `kubectl` and server or agent nodes) will fail to establish new connections, thus leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack.\n\n### Remediation\n\nUpgrade to a fixed release:\n\n- v1.28.1+k3s1\n- v1.27.5+k3s1\n- v1.26.8+k3s1\n- v1.25.13+k3s1\n- v1.24.17+k3s1\n\nIf you are using K3s 1.27 or earlier, you must also add  the parameter `tls-san-security: true` to the K3s configuration to enable enhanced security for the supervisor's TLS SAN list. This option defaults to `true` starting with K3s 1.28.\n\nNote that this flag changes the behavior of K3s servers. You should ensure that you configure `node-external-ip` on servers that will be connected to via an external IP, and add `tls-san` entries for any load-balancers or VIP addresses that will be associated with the supervisor port. External IPs and load-balancer/VIP addresses will no longer be added to the supervisor certificate's SAN list unless explicitly configured.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nIf you cannot upgrade to a fixed release, the certificate can be \"frozen\" by running the following command against the cluster:\n\n```shell\nkubectl annotate secret -n kube-system k3s-serving listener.cattle.io/static=true\n```\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f IMPORTANT CAUTION:** Note that this mitigation will prevent the certificate from adding new SAN entries when servers join the cluster, and automatically renewing itself when it is about to expire. If you do this, you should delete the annotation when adding new servers to the cluster, or when the certificate is within 90 days of expiring, so that it can be updated. Once that is done, you can freeze it again.\n\nAffected certificates can be reset by performing the following steps:\n1. Run `kubectl --server https://localhost:6444 delete secret -n kube-system k3s-serving`\n2. Delete `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/tls/dynamic-cert.json` from all servers, and restart the `k3s` service.\n\n### Background\n\nThe K3s apiserver/supervisor listener on port TCP 6443 and uses the `rancher/dynamiclistener` library to dynamically generate TLS certificates that contain TLS Subject Alternative Names (SAN) for any host name or IP address requested by a client. This is done to allow servers and external load-balancers to be added to the cluster without the administrator having to explicitly know and configure in advance a fixed list of endpoints that the supervisor may be hosted at.\n\nThe library allows the embedding application to configure a callback that is used to filter addresses requested by clients; but this was not previously implemented in K3s.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Reach out to the [K3s Security team](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/security/policy) for security related inquiries.\n- Open an issue in the [K3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/new/choose) repository.\n- Verify with our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-k3s/support-matrix/all-supported-versions) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/#k3s).", "methods": ["Used a TLS SAN stuffing attack to force the addition of entries to the certificate's Subject Alternative Name (SAN) list.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the K3s apiserver/supervisor port (TCP 6443) to perform an unauthenticated remote denial-of-service (DoS) attack.", "Used a stuffing attack to add entries to the certificate's SAN list until it exceeded the maximum size allowed by TLS client implementations.", "Exploited the lack of a callback to filter addresses requested by clients in the `rancher/dynamiclistener` library."]}
