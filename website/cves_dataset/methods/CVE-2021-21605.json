{"description": "Jenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier allows users with Agent/Configure permission to choose agent names that cause Jenkins to override unrelated `config.xml` files. If the global `config.xml` file is replaced, Jenkins will start up with unsafe legacy defaults after a restart.\n\nJenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 ensures that agent names are considered valid names for items to prevent this problem.\n\nIn case of problems, this change can be reverted by setting the [Java system property](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/) `jenkins.model.Nodes.enforceNameRestrictions` to `false`.", "methods": ["Manipulated Jenkins configuration to override unrelated config.xml files.", "Exploited a path traversal vulnerability in Jenkins agent names.", "Used a configuration file to set unsafe legacy defaults.", "Used a Java system property to bypass security restrictions."]}
