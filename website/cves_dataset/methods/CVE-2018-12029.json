{"description": "A race condition in the nginx module in Phusion Passenger 3.x through 5.x before 5.3.2 allows local escalation of privileges when a non-standard passenger_instance_registry_dir with insufficiently strict permissions is configured. Replacing a file with a symlink after the file was created, but before it was chowned, leads to the target of the link being chowned via the path. Targeting sensitive files such as root's crontab file allows privilege escalation.", "methods": ["Exploited a race condition in the nginx module in Phusion Passenger.", "Escalated privileges to root.", "Targeted sensitive files such as root's crontab file.", "Used a symlink to manipulate file ownership.", "Manipulated file permissions to achieve privilege escalation."]}
