{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe LDAP testing endpoint allows to change the Connection URL independently of and without having to re-enter the currently configured LDAP bind credentials. An attacker with admin access (permission manage-realm) can change the LDAP host URL (\"Connection URL\") to a machine they control. The Keycloak server will connect to the attacker's host and try to authenticate with the configured credentials, thus leaking them to the attacker.\nAs a consequence, an attacker who has compromised the admin console/compromised a user with sufficient privileges can leak domain credentials and can now attack the domain.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to Simon Wessling for reporting this issue and helping us improve our project", "methods": ["Leaked LDAP bind credentials through the Keycloak admin console.", "Changed the LDAP host URL to a machine controlled by the attacker.", "Used admin access to compromise the Keycloak server.", "Used compromised credentials to attack the domain."]}
