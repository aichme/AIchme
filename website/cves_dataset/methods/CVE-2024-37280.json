{"description": "A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch, affecting document ingestion when an index template contains a dynamic field mapping of \u201cpassthrough\u201d type. Under certain circumstances, ingesting documents in this index would cause a StackOverflow exception to be thrown and ultimately lead to a Denial of Service. Note that passthrough fields is an experimental feature.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in Elasticsearch.", "Caused a Denial of Service (DoS) by throwing a StackOverflow exception.", "Used an experimental feature (passthrough fields) for exploitation."]}
