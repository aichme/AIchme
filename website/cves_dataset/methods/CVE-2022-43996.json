{"description": "The csaf_provider package before 0.8.2 allows XSS via a crafted CSAF document uploaded as text/html. The endpoint upload allows valid CSAF advisories (JSON format) to be uploaded with Content-Type text/html and filenames ending in .html. When subsequently accessed via web browser, these advisories are served and interpreted as HTML pages. Such uploaded advisories can contain JavaScript code that will execute within the browser context of users inspecting the advisory.", "methods": ["Used a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability to execute JavaScript code within the browser context of users.", "Used a crafted CSAF document uploaded as text/html to bypass security controls.", "Used a web application endpoint to upload and serve malicious advisories as HTML pages."]}
