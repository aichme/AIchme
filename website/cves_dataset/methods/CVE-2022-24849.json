{"description": "### Impact\nUsers of versions 9.8.5, 9.8.6, 9.9.0 and previously published prereleases of 10.0.0 who have used either one of the two `RequireDisCatSharpDeveloperAttribute`s or the `BaseDiscordClient.LibraryDeveloperTeam` have potentially had their bot token sent to a web server not affiliated with Discord. This server is owned and operated by DisCatSharp's development team. The tokens were not logged, yet it is still advisable to reset the tokens of potentially affected bots.\n\n### Patches\n9.9.1 has been released to patch the issue for the current stable release and the current 10.0.0 prereleases are also no longer affected.\n\n### Workarounds\nRemove all uses of the two `RequireDisCatSharpDeveloperAttribute`s and all direct calls to `BaseDiscordClient.LibraryDeveloperTeam`.\n\n### Details\nThe `HttpClient` responsible for sending requests to the Discord API was erroneously reused to send requests to our website when DisCatSharp's team members were to be fetched.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GGYSywkxwN)\n* Email us at [ottero@aitsys.dev](mailto:ottero@aitsys.dev)\n", "methods": ["Sent sensitive information (bot token) to an unauthorized actor.", "Used an HTTP client to send requests to a web server not affiliated with the intended target.", "Used a reused HTTP client to send requests to an unintended target.", "Used a web server owned and operated by the development team to store sensitive information."]}
