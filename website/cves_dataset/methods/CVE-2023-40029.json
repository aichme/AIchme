{"description": "### Impact\n\nArgo CD Cluster secrets might be managed declaratively using Argo CD / kubectl apply. As a result, the full secret body is stored in`kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation. \n\nhttps://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/7139 introduced the ability to manage cluster labels and annotations. Since clusters are stored as secrets it also exposes the `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation which includes full secret body. In order to view the cluster annotations via the Argo CD API, the user must have `clusters, get` RBAC access.\n\n**Note:** In many cases, cluster secrets do not contain any actually-secret information. But sometimes, as in bearer-token auth, the contents might be very sensitive.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe bug has been patched in the following versions:\n\n* 2.8.3\n* 2.7.14\n* 2.6.15\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpdate/Deploy cluster secret with `server-side-apply` flag which does not use or rely on `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation. Note: annotation for existing secrets will require manual removal.\n\n### For more information\n\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd", "methods": ["Cluster secrets might be leaked via the Argo CD cluster details page.", "Secrets are stored in `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation.", "User with `clusters, get` RBAC access can view cluster annotations via the Argo CD API.", "Cluster secrets may contain sensitive information, such as bearer-token auth.", "Update/Deploy cluster secret with `server-side-apply` flag to avoid using `kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation."]}
