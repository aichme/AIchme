{"description": "### Summary\n\nMarkdown-based comments in the ZenUML diagram syntax are susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS).\n\n### Details\n\nThe comment feature allows the user to attach small notes for reference. This feature allows the user to enter in their comment in markdown comment, allowing them to use common markdown features, such as `**` for bolded text. However, the markdown text is currently not sanitized before rendering, allowing an attacker to enter a malicious payload for the comment which leads to XSS.\n\nhttps://github.com/mermaid-js/zenuml-core/blob/dcfee8cde42673c09e19401f43ad8506658c8442/src/components/DiagramFrame/SeqDiagram/MessageLayer/Block/Statement/Comment/Comment.vue#L65\n\n### PoC\n\n```\n// p<img onerror=alert(1) src=\"\"/>\nA->B:hi\n```\n\nAbove is a POC diagram payload that results in an XSS.\n\nHere is a similar POC in mermaid.live: https://mermaid.live/edit#pako:eNpNjrFuwyAQhl8F3dRK1DaQGhs1kVq1Y6duFQsylwTVgEWw1MTyuxc5S7df39399y0wRIug4IZh9qMOdU2mF-dPJAZMKaa9GTHlB_ZILmnYa9BQH3R4fTq8qbMDCh6TN86WhkUHQjTkM3rUoEq0Jv2Ui7CWPTPn-HUNA6icZqQwT9ZkfHfmlIwHdTTjpVC0Lsf0eVfazChMJoBa4BdUL6uGC8n7TrCGd5zCFRRnXbVjvBVNK3gJXbtSuMVYSlnFC-Kyf961UshWbmXf2-y_xcf29c7WP2yrVC0\n\n### Impact\n\nThis puts existing applications that use ZenUML **unsandboxed** at risk of arbitrary JavaScript execution when rendering user-controlled diagrams.", "methods": ["Used Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in ZenUML diagram comments.", "Used markdown-based comments in ZenUML diagram syntax to inject malicious payloads.", "Injected malicious payloads in markdown text, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution.", "Used unsandboxed rendering of user-controlled diagrams to execute malicious code."]}
