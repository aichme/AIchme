{"description": "### Impact\nThe `ImmutableConst` operation in TensorFlow can be tricked into reading arbitrary memory contents:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \nwith open('/tmp/test','wb') as f:\n    f.write(b'\\xe2'*128)\n    data = tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst(dtype=tf.string,shape=3,memory_region_name='/tmp/test')\n  \nprint(data)\n```\n  \nThis is because the `tstring` TensorFlow string class has a special case for memory mapped strings but the operation itself does not offer any support for this datatype.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [3712a2d3455e6ccb924daa5724a3652a86f6b585](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3712a2d3455e6ccb924daa5724a3652a86f6b585) and GitHub commit [1cb6bb6c2a6019417c9adaf9e6843ba75ee2580b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1cb6bb6c2a6019417c9adaf9e6843ba75ee2580b).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary memory read in `ImmutableConst` operation in TensorFlow.", "Used GitHub to patch the issue.", "Used GitHub to track the fix in TensorFlow 2.7.0 and backport to 2.6.1, 2.5.2, and 2.4.4."]}
