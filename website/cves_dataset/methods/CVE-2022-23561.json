{"description": "### Impact \nAn attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause a write outside of bounds of an array in TFLite. In fact, the attacker can override the linked list used by the memory allocator. This can be leveraged for an arbitrary write primitive under certain conditions.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [6c0b2b70eeee588591680f5b7d5d38175fd7cdf6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6c0b2b70eeee588591680f5b7d5d38175fd7cdf6).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n    \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n  \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Wang Xuan of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.", "methods": ["An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause a write outside of bounds of an array in TFLite, which can be leveraged for an arbitrary write primitive under certain conditions."]}
