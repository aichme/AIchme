This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long strings.\n\n## Patches\n\nPlease update uap-core to >= v0.11.0\n\nDownstream packages such as uap-python, uap-ruby etc which depend upon uap-core follow different version schemes.", "methods": ["Used maliciously crafted long strings in HTTP(S) requests to overload a server.", "Exploited overlapping capture groups in regexes to cause a Denial of Service (DoS)."]}
