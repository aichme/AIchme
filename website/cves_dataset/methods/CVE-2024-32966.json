{"description": "### Summary\nIf directory listings are enabled for a directory that an untrusted user has upload privileges for, a malicious file name like `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>.txt` will allow JavaScript code execution in the context of the web server\u2019s domain.\n\n### Details\nSWS generally does not perform escaping of HTML entities on any values inserted in the directory listing. At the very least `file_name` and `current_path` could contain malicious data however. `file_uri` could also be malicious but the relevant scenarios seem to be all caught by hyper.\n\n### Impact\nFor any web server that allow users to upload files or create directories under a name of their choosing this becomes a stored XSS vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in directory listings via file names.", "Used malicious file names to execute JavaScript code in the context of the web server's domain.", "Failed to perform escaping of HTML entities on user-controlled input."]}
