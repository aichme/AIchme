{"description": "### Impact\n`npm pack` ignores root-level `.gitignore` & `.npmignore` file exclusion directives when run in a workspace or with a workspace flag (ie. `--workspaces`, `--workspace=<name>`). Anyone who has run `npm pack` or `npm publish` with workspaces, as of [v7.9.0](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v7.9.0) & [v7.13.0](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v7.13.0) respectively, may be affected and have published files into the npm registry they did not intend to include.\n\n### Patch\n- Upgrade to the latest, patched version of `npm` ([`v8.11.0`](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v8.11.0) or greater), run: `npm i -g npm@latest`\n- Node.js versions [`v16.15.1`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v16.15.1), [`v17.19.1`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v17.9.1) & [`v18.3.0`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/releases/tag/v18.3.0) include the patched `v8.11.0` version of `npm`\n\n#### Steps to take to see if you're impacted\n1. Run `npm publish --dry-run` or `npm pack` with an `npm` version `>=7.9.0` & `<8.11.0` inside the project's root directory using a workspace flag like: `--workspaces` or `--workspace=<name>` (ex. `npm pack --workspace=foo`)\n2. Check the output in your terminal which will list the package contents (note: `tar -tvf <package-on-disk>` also works)\n3. If you find that there are files included you did not expect, you should:\n  3.1. Create & publish a new release excluding those files (ref. [\"Keeping files out of your Package\"](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/developers#keeping-files-out-of-your-package))\n  3.2. Deprecate the old package (ex. `npm deprecate <pkg>[@<version>] <message>`)\n  3.3. Revoke or rotate any sensitive information (ex. passwords, tokens, secrets etc.) which might have been exposed\n### References\n- [CVE-2022-29244](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29244)\n- [`npm-packlist`](https://github.com/npm/npm-packlist)\n- [`libnpmpack`](https://github.com/npm/cli/tree/latest/workspaces/libnpmpack)\n- [`libnpmpublish`](https://github.com/npm/cli/tree/latest/workspaces/libnpmpublish)", "methods": ["Used npm publish with workspace flag to bypass ignore files.", "Used npm pack with workspace flag to bypass ignore files.", "Used npm publish with version >=7.9.0 and <8.11.0 to bypass ignore files.", "Used npm pack with version >=7.9.0 and <8.11.0 to bypass ignore files.", "Used tar to list package contents.", "Used npm deprecate to revoke sensitive information.", "Used npm deprecate to revoke sensitive information exposed by the vulnerability."]}
