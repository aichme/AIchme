{"description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows a sandboxed renderer to request a \"thumbnail\" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases.\n\nAll current stable versions of Electron are affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis was fixed with #30728, and the following Electron versions contain the fix:\n\n- 15.0.0-alpha.10\n- 14.0.0\n- 13.3.0\n- 12.1.0\n- 11.5.0\n\n### Workarounds\nIf your app enables `contextIsolation`, this vulnerability is significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit.\n\nFurther, if your app does not depend on the `createThumbnailFromPath` API, then you can simply disable the functionality. In the main process, before the 'ready' event:\n```js\ndelete require('electron').nativeImage.createThumbnailFromPath\n```\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org).", "methods": ["Used the nativeImage API to obtain thumbnails of arbitrary files.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Electron to access sensitive information.", "Used the createThumbnailFromPath API to request thumbnails of arbitrary files.", "Exploited a sandboxed renderer to access the user's system."]}
