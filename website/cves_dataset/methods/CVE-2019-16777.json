{"description": "Versions of  the npm CLI prior to 6.13.4 are vulnerable to a Global node_modules Binary Overwrite. It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be overwritten by other package installations. \n\nFor example, if a package was installed globally and created a `serve` binary, any subsequent installs of packages that also create a `serve` binary would overwrite the first binary. This will not overwrite system binaries but only binaries put into the global node_modules directory.\n\nThis behavior is still allowed in local installations and also through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 6.13.4 or later.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in npm to overwrite binaries in the global node_modules directory.", "Bypassed security controls by using install scripts.", "Exploited a vulnerability in a package installation process."]}
