{"description": "There is a possible denial of service vulnerability in the multipart parsing component of Rack.  This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-30122.\n\nVersions Affected:  >= 1.2\nNot affected:       < 1.2\nFixed Versions:     2.0.9.1, 2.1.4.1, 2.2.3.1\n\n## Impact\nCarefully crafted multipart POST requests can cause Rack's multipart parser to take much longer than expected, leading to a possible denial of service vulnerability.\n\nImpacted code will use Rack's multipart parser to parse multipart posts.  This includes directly using the multipart parser like this:\n\n```\nparams = Rack::Multipart.parse_multipart(env)\n```\n\nBut it also includes reading POST data from a Rack request object like this:\n\n```\np request.POST # read POST data\np request.params # reads both query params and POST data\n```\n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.\n\n## Workarounds\nThere are no feasible workarounds for this issue.\n", "methods": ["Impacts Rack's multipart parser to cause a denial of service.", "Carefully crafted multipart POST requests can cause a denial of service.", "Impacted code uses Rack's multipart parser to parse multipart posts.", "Reading POST data from a Rack request object can cause a denial of service."]}
