{"description": "## Impact\n\nThere is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the ACME HTTP challenge.\n\nWhen Traefik is configured to use the [HTTPChallenge](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#httpchallenge) to generate and renew the Let's Encrypt TLS certificates, the delay authorized to solve the challenge (50 seconds) can be exploited by attackers ([slowloris attack](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/ddos-attack-tools/slowloris/)).\n \n## Patches\n\n- https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.10.6\n- https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta5\n\n## Workarounds\n\nReplace the HTTPChallenge with the [TLSChallenge](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#tlschallenge) or the [DNSChallenge](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/#dnschallenge).\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues).", "methods": ["Exploits a delay in the ACME HTTP challenge to perform a slowloris attack.", "Uses a slowloris attack to perform a DDoS."]}
