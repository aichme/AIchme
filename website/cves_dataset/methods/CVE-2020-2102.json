{"description": "Jenkins 2.218 and earlier, LTS 2.204.1 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether two HMACs are equal. This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain a valid HMAC for an attacker-controlled input value.\n\nJenkins 2.219, LTS 2.204.2 now uses a constant-time comparison when validating HMACs.", "methods": ["Used statistical methods to obtain a valid HMAC for an attacker-controlled input value.", "Exploited a non-constant time HMAC comparison."]}
