{"description": "In elliptic-php versions priot to 1.0.6, Timing attacks might be possible which can result in practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library under certain conditions. Leakage of a bit-length of the scalar during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve which might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.", "methods": ["Timing attacks to recover long-term private key", "Leakage of sensitive information during scalar multiplication"]}
