{"description": "# Duplicate Advisory\n\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because it is a duplicate of GHSA-c92w-72c5-9x59. This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n# Original Description\n\nA security issue was discovered in kube-state-metrics 1.7.x before 1.7.2. An experimental feature was added to v1.7.0 and v1.7.1 that enabled annotations to be exposed as metrics. By default, kube-state-metrics metrics only expose metadata about Secrets. However, a combination of the default kubectl behavior and this new feature can cause the entire secret content to end up in metric labels, thus inadvertently exposing the secret content in metrics.", "methods": ["Exposed sensitive information through an experimental feature in kube-state-metrics.", "Exploited default kubectl behavior to expose sensitive information.", "Exposed secret content in metric labels."]}
