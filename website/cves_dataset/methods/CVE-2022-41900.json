{"description": "### Impact\nAn input `pooling_ratio` that is smaller than 1 will trigger a heap OOB in [`tf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPool`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_max_pool_op.cc) and [`tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc).\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [216525144ee7c910296f5b05d214ca1327c9ce48](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/216525144ee7c910296f5b05d214ca1327c9ce48).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherry pick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n", "methods": ["Heap out-of-bounds access via input `pooling_ratio` smaller than 1 in `tf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPool` and `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPool`."]}
