{"description": "### Impact\n\nConverting a string (from Python) to a `tf.float16` value results in a segmentation fault in eager mode as the format checks for this use case are only in the graph mode.\n\nThis issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training where a malicious attacker can send a data point which contains a string instead of a `tf.float16` value.\n\nSimilar effects can be obtained by manipulating saved models and checkpoints whereby replacing a scalar `tf.float16` value with a scalar string will trigger this issue due to automatic conversions.\n\nThis can be easily reproduced by `tf.constant(\"hello\", tf.float16)`, if eager execution is enabled.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the vulnerability in GitHub commit [5ac1b9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5ac1b9e24ff6afc465756edf845d2e9660bd34bf).\n\nWe are additionally releasing TensorFlow 1.15.1 and 2.0.1 with this vulnerability patched.\n\nTensorFlow 2.1.0 was released after we fixed the issue, thus it is not affected.\n\nWe encourage users to switch to TensorFlow 1.15.1, 2.0.1 or 2.1.0.\n\n### For more information\n\nPlease consult [`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["Denial of Service (DoS) via segmentation fault in TensorFlow when converting a Python string to `tf.float16`.", "Manipulation of saved models and checkpoints to trigger segmentation fault.", "Sending malicious data points to trigger segmentation fault in inference/training."]}
