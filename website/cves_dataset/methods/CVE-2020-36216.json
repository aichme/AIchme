{"description": "Input<R> implements Send without requiring R: Send.\n\nAffected versions of this crate allows users to send non-Send types to other threads, which can lead to undefined behavior such as data race and memory corruption.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version 0.5.1 by adding R: Send bound to the Send impl of Input<R>.", "methods": ["Allows data to be sent between threads without proper synchronization.", "Leads to data race and memory corruption.", "Allows non-Send types to be sent between threads."]}
