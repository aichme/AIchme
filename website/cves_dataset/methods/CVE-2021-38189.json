{"description": "### Impact\n\nAffected versions of lettre allowed SMTP command injection through an attacker's controlled message body. The module for escaping lines starting with a period wouldn't catch a period that was placed after a double CRLF sequence, allowing the attacker to end the current message and write arbitrary SMTP commands after it.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe flaw is fixed by correctly handling consecutive CRLF sequences.\n\n### References\n\n* [RUSTSEC-2021-0069](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2021-0069.html)\n\n\n\n", "methods": ["Injected SMTP commands through a controlled message body.", "Executed arbitrary SMTP commands after the current message.", "Exploited a flaw in the handling of consecutive CRLF sequences."]}
