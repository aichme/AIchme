{"description": "### Impact\nWhen the `boxes` argument of `tf.image.crop_and_resize` has a very large value, the CPU kernel implementation receives it as a C++ `nan` floating point value. Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later produces a segmentation fault.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe have patched the issue in c0319231333f0f16e1cc75ec83660b01fedd4182 and will release TensorFlow 2.4.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported in #42129", "methods": ["Attempted to exploit undefined behavior in CPU kernel implementation.", "Triggered segmentation fault."]}
