{"description": "A path traversal vulnerability exists in the parisneo/lollms application, specifically within the `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` and `sanitize_path` functions in `lollms_core\\lollms\\security.py`. This vulnerability allows for arbitrary file reading when the application is running on Windows. The issue arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, enabling attackers to bypass the path traversal protection mechanisms by crafting malicious input. Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, information disclosure, and potentially a denial of service (DoS) condition by including numerous large or resource-intensive files. This vulnerability affects the latest version prior to 9.5.0.", "methods": ["Bypassed path traversal protection mechanisms by crafting malicious input.", "Read arbitrary files on the system.", "Caused a denial of service (DoS) condition by including numerous large or resource-intensive files."]}
