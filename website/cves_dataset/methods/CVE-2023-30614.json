{"description": "### Impact\nA payments info page of Pay is susceptible to reflected Cross-site scripting. An attacker could create a working URL that renders a javascript link to a user on a Rails application that integrates Pay. This URL could be distributed via email to specifically target certain individuals. If the targeted application contains a functionality to submit user-generated content (such as comments) the attacker could even distribute the URL using that functionality.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in version 6.3.2 and above.\n\nPay will now sanitize the `back` parameter and only permit relative paths.\n", "methods": ["Used reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) to inject malicious JavaScript.", "Distributed malicious URLs via email to target specific individuals.", "Used user-generated content (e.g. comments) to spread malicious URLs.", "Used a vulnerability in a Rails application to execute malicious JavaScript."]}
