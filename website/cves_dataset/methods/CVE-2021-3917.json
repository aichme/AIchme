{"description": "### Impact\nOn systems installed with coreos-installer before 0.10.0, the user-provided Ignition config was written to `/boot/ignition/config.ign` with world-readable permissions, granting unprivileged users access to any secrets included in the config.\n\nDefault configurations of Fedora CoreOS and RHEL CoreOS do not include any unprivileged user accounts.  In addition, instances launched from a cloud image, and systems provisioned with the `ignition.config.url` kernel argument, do not use the `config.ign` file and are unaffected.\n\n### Patches\ncoreos-installer 0.10.0 and later [writes](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/pull/571) the Ignition config with restricted permissions.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOn Fedora CoreOS systems installed from version 34.20210711.3.0 (stable), 34.20210711.2.0 (testing), 34.20210711.1.1 (next) and later, the `/boot/ignition` directory and its contents are removed after provisioning is complete. All Fedora CoreOS systems that have updated to these versions or later have automatically removed the `/boot/ignition` directory and no action is required.\n\nOn other systems, `/boot/ignition/config.ign` can be removed manually, as it is not used after provisioning is complete:\n\n```\nsudo mount -o remount,rw /boot\nsudo rm -rf /boot/ignition\n```\n\n### References\nFor more information, see https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/889.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, [open an issue in coreos-installer](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-installer/issues/new/choose) or email the CoreOS [development mailing list](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/coreos@lists.fedoraproject.org/).", "methods": ["Writes world-readable Ignition config to installed system.", "Uses unprivileged user accounts.", "Uses secrets included in the config.", "Writes Ignition config with restricted permissions.", "Removes /boot/ignition directory and its contents.", "Removes /boot/ignition/config.ign manually."]}
