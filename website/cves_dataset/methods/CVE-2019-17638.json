{"description": "In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.4.27.v20200227 to 9.4.29.v20200521, in case of too large response headers, Jetty throws an exception to produce an HTTP 431 error. When this happens, the ByteBuffer containing the HTTP response headers is released back to the ByteBufferPool twice. Because of this double release, two threads can acquire the same ByteBuffer from the pool and while thread1 is about to use the ByteBuffer to write response1 data, thread2 fills the ByteBuffer with response2 data. Thread1 then proceeds to write the buffer that now contains response2 data. This results in client1, which issued request1 and expects responses, to see response2 which could contain sensitive data belonging to client2 (HTTP session ids, authentication credentials, etc.).", "methods": ["Released a ByteBuffer back to the ByteBufferPool twice.", "Two threads acquired the same ByteBuffer from the pool.", "Thread1 wrote response1 data to the buffer that was filled with response2 data by thread2.", "Client1 received response2 data that belonged to client2.", "Sensitive data was exposed, including HTTP session ids and authentication credentials."]}
