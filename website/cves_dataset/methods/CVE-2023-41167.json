{"description": "## Overview\n`@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer` is a react component to render data coming from Webiny Headless CMS and Webiny Form Builder. The `@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer` package depends on the [editor.js](https://editorjs.io/) rich text editor to handle rich text content. The CMS stores rich text content from the `editor.js` into the database. When the `@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer` is used to render such content, it uses the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop, without applying HTML sanitization. The issue arises when an actor, who in this context would specifically be a content manager with access to the CMS, inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined input. This script is then injected and executed within the user's browser when the main page or admin page loads.\n\n## Am I affected?\nYou will be affected if you're running a Webiny project created prior to `5.35.0` and you're using the legacy rich text editor (which uses `editor.js` library under the hood). If you've already switched to using the new rich text editor, powered by Lexical editor, you will not be affected by this.\n\n## How do I patch this vulnerability?\nUpdate to Webiny version `5.37.2`.\n", "methods": ["Injects malicious scripts into user-defined input.", "Uses `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop without HTML sanitization.", "Executes scripts within the user's browser."]}
