{"description": "In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99 the HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.", "methods": ["Used HTTP header parsing code with an approach to end-of-line parsing that allowed invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Apache Tomcat to smuggle HTTP requests.", "Leveraged a reverse proxy to incorrectly handle the Transfer-Encoding header."]}
