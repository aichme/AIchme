This allowed users with Jenkins controller local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password. The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations. GitHub Pull Request Builder Plugin 1.32.1 and newer stores the webhook secret encrypted on disk.", "methods": ["Stored sensitive information in plain text.", "Used local file system access to retrieve sensitive information.", "Exploited browser extensions for information exposure.", "Exploited cross-site scripting vulnerabilities for information exposure.", "Used Jenkins administrators for unauthorized access to sensitive information."]}
