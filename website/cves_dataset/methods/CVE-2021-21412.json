{"description": "### Impact\n\nPotential for arbitrary code execution in `#gpg`-tagged property values (only if `decrypt: true` option is enabled)\n\n### Patches\n\n[A fix](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/3e14765d6bfd8006742c9e7860bc7d58ae94dfa5) has already been released as v0.4.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nBy default, EGF parse functions do NOT attempt to decrypt values (since GPG is only available in non-browser env).\n\nHowever, if GPG encrypted values are used/required:\n\n1. Perform a regex search for `#gpg`-tagged values in the EGF source file/string and check for backtick (\\`) chars in the encrypted value string\n2. Replace/remove them or skip parsing if present...\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/security/advisories/GHSA-rj44-gpjc-29r7#advisory-comment-65261\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please open an issue in the [thi.ng/umbrella repo](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/issues), of which this package is part of.", "methods": ["Potential arbitrary code execution in `#gpg`-tagged property values.", "Use of GPG encryption with `decrypt: true` option enabled.", "Use of backtick (\\`) chars in encrypted value string.", "Use of regex search for `#gpg`-tagged values in EGF source file/string.", "Use of GPG in non-browser environment.", "Use of EGF parse functions that attempt to decrypt values.", "Use of EGF source file/string with `#gpg`-tagged values."]}
