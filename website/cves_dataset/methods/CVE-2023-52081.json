{"description": "### Summary\nThe function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. However, due to the use of late Unicode normalization of type NFKD, it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. \n\n```go\n// lookupPreprocess applies transformations to s so that it can be compared\n// to search for something.\n// For example, it is used by (ThemeStore).Lookup\nfunc lookupPreprocess(s string) string {\n\treturn strings.ToLower(norm.NFKD.String(regexp.MustCompile(`[-_ .]`).ReplaceAllString(s, \"\")))\n}\n``` \n\nTake the following equivalent Unicode character U+2024 (\u2024). Initially, the `lookupPreprocess()` function would compile the regex and replace the regular dot (.). However, the U+2024 (\u2024) would bypass the `ReplaceAllString()`. When the normalization operation is applied to U+2024 (\u2024), the resulting character will be U+002E (.). Thus, the dot was reintroduced back.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe `lookupPreprocess()` can be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (\ufe4d), which would result in the omitted U+005F (_), for instance. It should be noted here that the variable `s` is user-controlled data coming from [/cmd/ffcss/commands.go#L22-L28](https://github.com/ewen-lbh/ffcss/blob/master/cmd/ffcss/commands.go#L22-L28) the command args. The `lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes loosely (case insensitively, while ignoring dashes, underscores and dots), so the actual security impact is classified as low.\n\n### Remediation\n\nA simple fix would be to initially perform the Unicode normalization and then the rest of validations.\n\n### References\n\n - https://sim4n6.beehiiv.com/p/unicode-characters-bypass-security-checks\n", "methods": ["Used Unicode normalization to bypass input validation.", "Used equivalent Unicode characters to evade security checks.", "Used user-controlled data to manipulate input validation.", "Used Unicode characters to reintroduce characters that were previously removed by a regex."]}
