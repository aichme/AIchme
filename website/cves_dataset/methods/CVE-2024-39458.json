{"description": "Structs Plugin provides utility functionality used, e.g., in Pipeline to instantiate and configure build steps, typically before their execution.\n\nWhen Structs Plugin 337.v1b_04ea_4df7c8 and earlier fails to configure a build step, it logs a warning message containing diagnostic information that may contain secrets passed as step parameters.\n\nThis can result in accidental exposure of secrets through the default system log.\n\nStructs Plugin 338.v848422169819 inspects the types of actual parameters before logging these warning messages, and limits detailed diagnostic information to FINE level log messages if secrets are involved. These log messages are not displayed in the default Jenkins system log.\n", "methods": ["Leverages system logging for C2.", "Exposes secrets through system logging.", "Uses default system logging for information disclosure.", "Uses logging for unintended information disclosure."]}
