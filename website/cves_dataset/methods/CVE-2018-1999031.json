{"description": "An exposure of sensitive information vulnerability exists in Jenkins meliora-testlab Plugin 1.14 and earlier in TestlabNotifier.java that allows attackers with file system access to the Jenkins master to obtain the API key stored in this plugin's configuration. Additionally, the API key was not masked from view using a password form field. As of version 1.15, the plugin stores the API Key encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.", "methods": ["Used file system access to obtain sensitive information (API key).", "Exposed sensitive information in plain text.", "Used encryption to protect sensitive information (API key).", "Stored sensitive information in configuration files on disk."]}
