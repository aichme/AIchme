{"description": "Ratpack versions before 1.6.1 generate a session ID using a cryptographically weak PRNG in the JDK's ThreadLocalRandom. This means that if an attacker can determine a small window for the server start time and obtain a session ID value, they can theoretically determine the sequence of session IDs.", "methods": ["Uses a weak PRNG to generate session IDs.", "Allows an attacker to determine the sequence of session IDs.", "Allows an attacker to obtain session IDs within a small window of server start time."]}
