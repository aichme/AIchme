{"description": "### Impact\nThe [shape inference code for `DeserializeSparse`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/ops/sparse_ops.cc#L152-L168) can trigger a null pointer dereference:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(3)\n  \n@tf.function                 \ndef test():                  \n  y = tf.raw_ops.DeserializeSparse(\n    serialized_sparse=tf.data.experimental.to_variant(dataset),\n    dtype=tf.int32)\n\ntest()\n```\n\nThis is because the shape inference function assumes that the `serialize_sparse` tensor is a tensor with positive rank (and having `3` as the last dimension).  However, in the example above, the argument is a scalar (i.e., rank 0).\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [d3738dd70f1c9ceb547258cbb82d853da8771850](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d3738dd70f1c9ceb547258cbb82d853da8771850).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Triggered a null pointer dereference in `DeserializeSparse` by passing a scalar tensor with rank 0.", "Exploited a vulnerability in TensorFlow's shape inference code."]}
