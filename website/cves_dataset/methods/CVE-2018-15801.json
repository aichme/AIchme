{"description": "Spring Security versions 5.1.x prior to 5.1.2 contain an authorization bypass vulnerability during JWT issuer validation. In order to be impacted, the same private key for an honest issuer and a malicious user must be used when signing JWTs. In that case, a malicious user could fashion signed JWTs with the malicious issuer URL that may be granted for the honest issuer.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable library (Spring Security) to bypass authorization.", "Used a private key to sign malicious JWTs.", "Created signed JWTs with a malicious issuer URL."]}
