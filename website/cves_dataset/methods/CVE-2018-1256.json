{"description": "Spring Cloud SSO Connector, version 2.1.2, contains a regression which disables issuer validation in resource servers that are not bound to the SSO service. In PCF deployments with multiple SSO service plans, a remote attacker can authenticate to unbound resource servers which use this version of the SSO Connector with tokens generated from another service plan.\n\n### Mitigation\nUsers of affected versions should apply the following mitigation:\n* Releases that have fixed this issue include:</p><ul><li>Spring Cloud SSO Connector: 2.1.3</li></ul>\n* Alternatively, you can perform <u>one</u> of the following workarounds:</p><ul><li>Bind your resource server to the SSO service plan via a service instance binding</li><li>Set \u201csso.connector.cloud.available=true\u201d within your Spring application properties</li></ul>\n\n", "methods": ["A remote attacker can authenticate to unbound resource servers.", "A remote attacker can authenticate to unbound resource servers with tokens generated from another service plan.", "Bind your resource server to the SSO service plan via a service instance binding.", "Set \u201csso.connector.cloud.available=true\u201d within your Spring application properties."]}
