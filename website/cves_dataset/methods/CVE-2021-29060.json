{"description": "In the npm package `color-string`, there is a  ReDos (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability regarding an exponential time complexity for\nlinearly increasing input lengths for `hwb()` color strings.\n\nStrings reaching more than 5000 characters would see several\nmilliseconds of processing time; strings reaching more than\n50,000 characters began seeing 1500ms (1.5s) of processing time.\n\nThe cause was due to a the regular expression that parses\nhwb() strings - specifically, the hue value - where\nthe integer portion of the hue value used a 0-or-more quantifier\nshortly thereafter followed by a 1-or-more quantifier.\n\nThis caused excessive backtracking and a cartesian scan,\nresulting in exponential time complexity given a linear\nincrease in input length.", "methods": ["Used a regular expression with excessive backtracking and cartesian scan to cause a denial of service.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the npm package `color-string` to cause a denial of service.", "Created input with a linearly increasing length to cause a denial of service.", "Used a 0-or-more quantifier shortly followed by a 1-or-more quantifier in a regular expression to cause excessive backtracking."]}
