{"description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability exposes Aurelia application that uses `aurelia-path` package to parse a string. The majority of this will be Aurelia applications that employ the `aurelia-router` package. An example is this could allow an attacker to change the prototype of base object class `Object` by tricking an application to parse the following URL: `https://aurelia.io/blog/?__proto__[asdf]=asdf`\n\n### Patches\nThe problem should be patched in version `1.1.7`. Any version earlier than this is vulnerable.\n\n### Workarounds\nA partial work around is to free the Object prototype:\n```ts\nObject.freeze(Object.prototype)\n```", "methods": ["Manipulated the prototype of the base object class `Object` to change its behavior.", "Tricked an application to parse a malicious URL to exploit the vulnerability.", "Used a URL to inject malicious code into an application.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the `aurelia-path` package to gain control over the application."]}
