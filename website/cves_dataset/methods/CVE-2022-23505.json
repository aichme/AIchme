{"description": "# Overview\nA remote attacker can bypass WSFed authentication on a website using passport-wsfed-saml2. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed WSFed assertion. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered.\n\n# Am I affected?\nYou are affected if you are using WSFed protocol with the passport-wsfed-saml2 library versions < 4.6.3. \nSAML2 protocol is not affected. \n\n# How do I fix it?\nUpgrade the library to version 4.6.3.\n\n# Will the fix impact my users?\nNo, the fix will not impact your users.", "methods": ["Bypasses authentication using an arbitrary IDP signed WSFed assertion.", "Uses a vulnerability in the passport-wsfed-saml2 library to bypass authentication.", "Exploits a vulnerability in the WSFed protocol."]}
