{"description": "### Impact\n* Client implementations using this library\n\n### Issues\n1) The IdToken signature algorithm was not checked automatically, but only if the expected algorithm was passed in as a kwarg.\n2) JWA `none` algorithm was allowed in all flows.\n3) `oic.consumer.Consumer.parse_authz` returns an unverified IdToken. The verification of the token was left to the discretion of the implementator.\n4) `iat` claim was not checked for sanity (i.e. it could be in the future)\n\n### Patches\n1) IdToken signature is now always checked.\n2) JWA `none` algorithm is now allowed only if using the `response_type` `code`\n3) IdToken verification is now done automatically.\n4) `iat` claim is now checked for sanity.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable library (Python oic) in client implementations.", "Failed to verify the IdToken signature.", "Failed to check the JWA algorithm for sanity.", "Failed to verify the IdToken.", "Failed to check the iat claim for sanity.", "Allowed the JWA 'none' algorithm in all flows.", "Allowed the use of an unverified IdToken in the `oic.consumer.Consumer.parse_authz` function."]}
