{"description": "### Impact\nWhen saving the contents of a rich text field in the admin interface, Wagtail does not apply server-side checks to ensure that link URLs use a valid protocol. A malicious user with access to the admin interface could thus craft a POST request to publish content with `javascript:` URLs containing arbitrary code. The vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.11.7 (for the LTS 2.11 branch) and Wagtail 2.12.4 (for the current 2.12 branch).\n\n### Workarounds\nFor sites that cannot easily upgrade to a current supported version, the vulnerability can be patched by adding the following code to a `wagtail_hooks.py` module in any installed app:\n\n```python\nfrom draftjs_exporter.dom import DOM\nfrom wagtail.admin.rich_text.converters.html_to_contentstate import ExternalLinkElementHandler, PageLinkElementHandler\nfrom wagtail.core import hooks\nfrom wagtail.core.whitelist import check_url\n\n\ndef link_entity(props):\n    id_ = props.get('id')\n    link_props = {}\n\n    if id_ is not None:\n        link_props['linktype'] = 'page'\n        link_props['id'] = id_\n    else:\n        link_props['href'] = check_url(props.get('url'))\n\n    return DOM.create_element('a', link_props, props['children'])\n\n\n@hooks.register('register_rich_text_features', order=1)\ndef register_link(features):\n    features.register_converter_rule('contentstate', 'link', {\n        'from_database_format': {\n            'a[href]': ExternalLinkElementHandler('LINK'),\n            'a[linktype=\"page\"]': PageLinkElementHandler('LINK'),\n        },\n        'to_database_format': {\n            'entity_decorators': {'LINK': link_entity}\n        }\n    })\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to Kevin Breen for reporting this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Visit Wagtail's [support channels](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/support.html)\n* Email us at security@wagtail.io (if you wish to send encrypted email, the public key ID is `0x6ba1e1a86e0f8ce8`)", "methods": ["Used Cross-site Scripting (XSS) to inject arbitrary code via `javascript:` URLs in Wagtail rich text fields.", "Used a POST request to publish content with malicious URLs.", "Used access to the Wagtail admin interface to exploit the vulnerability."]}
