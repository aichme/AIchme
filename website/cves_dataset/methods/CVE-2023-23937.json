{"description": "### Impact\nThe upload functionality for updating user profile does not properly validate the file content-type, allowing any authenticated user to bypass this security check by adding a valid signature (p.e. GIF89) and sending any invalid content-type. This could allow an authenticated attacker to upload HTML files with JS content that will be executed in the context of the domain.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to version 10.5.16 or apply this patch manually https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/pull/14125.patch", "methods": ["Used Unrestricted File Upload to upload HTML files with JS content.", "Executed malicious code in the context of the domain.", "Bypassed security checks by manipulating file content-type."]}
