{"description": "object-path is vulnerable to Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution'). The `del()` function fails to validate which Object properties it deletes. This allows attackers to modify the prototype of Object, causing the modification of default properties like `toString` on all objects.", "methods": ["Manipulated object properties to modify default behavior.", "Exploited a vulnerability in a library to gain unauthorized access to object attributes.", "Used a library with a flawed validation mechanism to delete object properties.", "Modified the prototype of an object to alter its behavior."]}
