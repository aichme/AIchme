{"description": "All 2.0.X, 2.1.X, 2.2.X, 2.3.X, 2.4.X, and 2.5.X versions of the Symfony HttpFoundation component are affected by this security issue.\n\nThis issue has been fixed in Symfony 2.3.19, 2.4.9, and 2.5.4. Note that no fixes are provided for Symfony 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 as they are not maintained anymore.\n\nDescription\nWhen an arbitrarily long hostname is sent by a client, its parsing in `Request::getHost()` can lead to a DoS attack, due to the way we validate the hostname via a regular expression.\n\nResolution\nThe regular expression used to parse and validate the hostname from the HTTP request has been modified to avoid too much sensitivity to the submitted value length.\n\nThe patch for this issue is available here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/11828", "methods": ["Attempted to cause a denial of service (DoS) via a malicious HTTP Host header.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the Symfony HttpFoundation component.", "Used a regular expression to parse and validate the hostname from the HTTP request.", "Sent an arbitrarily long hostname to cause a DoS attack."]}
