{"description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to ping floods, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\ngolang.org/x/net/http2", "methods": ["Conducts a denial of service attack using ping floods.", "Exploits a vulnerability in golang.org/x/net/http2 to consume excess CPU and memory."]}
