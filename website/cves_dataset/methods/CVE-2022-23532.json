{"description": "### Impact\nA Path Traversal Vulnerability found in the apoc.export.* procedures of apoc plugins in Neo4j Graph database.\nThe issue allows a malicious actor to potentially break out of the expected directory. The vulnerability is such that files could only be created but not overwritten.\n\nFor the vulnerability to be exploited, an attacker would need access to execute an arbitrary query, either by having access to an authenticated Neo4j client, or a Cypher injection vulnerability in an application. The procedure would need to have been allow listed in the neo4j configuration as well as having the apoc config `apoc.export.file.enabled` set to true. \n\nOn a UNIX based system the following query allows arbitrary write access to the tmp folder:\n\nCALL apoc.export.csv.query('RETURN 1', 'file:///..//..//..//..//tmp/test.txt', {})\n\n### Patches\nThe users should aim to use the latest released version compatible with their Neo4j version. The minimum versions containing patch for this vulnerability are 4.4.0.12 and 4.3.0.12.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the\u00a0[allowlist of the ](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.security.procedures.allowlist)procedures\u00a0that can be used in your system, and/or turn off local file access by setting apoc.export.file.enabled=false\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in\u00a0[neo4j-apoc-procedures](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures)\n* Email us at\u00a0[security@neo4j.com](mailto:security@neo4j.com)\n\n### Credits\nWe want to publicly recognise the contribution Adam Reziouk - Airbus.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary query execution to access Neo4j database.", "Used Cypher injection to execute malicious queries.", "Used path traversal to break out of expected directory and write to arbitrary files.", "Used allowlisted procedures to execute malicious queries.", "Used misconfigured apoc.export.file.enabled to enable local file access.", "Used file path manipulation to write to tmp folder."]}
