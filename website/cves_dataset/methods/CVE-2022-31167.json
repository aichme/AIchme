{"description": "### Impact\n\nA bug in the security cache is storing rules associated to document Page1.Page2 and space Page1.Page2 in the same cache entry.\n\nThat means that it's possible to overwrite the rights of a space or a document by creating the page of the space with the same name and checking the right of the new one first so that they end up in the security cache and are used for the other too.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in XWiki 12.10.11, 13.10.1, 13.4.6.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround other than patching.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-14075\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18983\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Stored XSS through overwriting of security rules of a page with a final page having the same reference.", "Manipulation of security cache to overwrite rights of a space or document."]}
