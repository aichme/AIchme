{"description": "Cure53 DOMPurify before 2.0.17 allows mutation XSS. This occurs because a serialize-parse roundtrip does not necessarily return the original DOM tree, and a namespace can change from HTML to MathML, as demonstrated by nesting of FORM elements.", "methods": ["Used Cross-site Scripting (XSS) to inject malicious code.", "Exploited a vulnerability in DOMPurify to achieve mutation XSS.", "Used a serialize-parse roundtrip to manipulate the DOM tree.", "Leveraged a namespace change from HTML to MathML to evade detection."]}
