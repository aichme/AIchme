{"description": "Versions of `kill-port` prior to 1.3.2 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package does not validate user input on the `kill` function. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system if user input (such as the port number) is passed directly to the function.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 1.3.2 or later.", "methods": ["Command Injection in the `kill-port` function.", "Lack of input validation on the `kill` function.", "Execution of arbitrary system commands."]}
