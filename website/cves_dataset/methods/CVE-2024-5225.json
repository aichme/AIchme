{"description": "An SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the berriai/litellm repository, specifically within the `/global/spend/logs` endpoint. The vulnerability arises due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command. The affected code constructs an SQL query by concatenating an unvalidated `api_key` parameter directly into the query, making it susceptible to SQL Injection if the `api_key` contains malicious data. This issue affects the latest version of the repository. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, exposure of confidential information, and denial of service (DoS).", "methods": ["Injects malicious data into SQL queries through unvalidated parameters.", "Manipulates SQL commands to gain unauthorized access and data control.", "Exposes confidential information through exploitation of the vulnerability.", "Causes denial of service (DoS) through successful exploitation."]}
