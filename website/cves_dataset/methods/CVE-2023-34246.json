{"description": "OAuth RFC 8252 says  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252#section-8.6\n\n> the authorization server SHOULD NOT process authorization requests automatically without user consent or interaction, except when the identity of the client can be assured. **This includes the case where the user has previously approved an authorization request for a given client id**\n\nBut Doorkeeper automatically processes authorization requests without user consent for public clients that have been previously approved. Public clients are inherently vulnerable to impersonation, their identity cannot be assured.\n\nIssue https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/issues/1589\n\nFix https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/pull/1646", "methods": ["Impersonation of a public client.", "Lack of user consent or interaction for authorization requests.", "Automatic processing of authorization requests without user interaction.", "Insecure handling of client identity."]}
