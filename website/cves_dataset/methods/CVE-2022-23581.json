{"description": "### Impact\nThe Grappler optimizer in TensorFlow can be used to cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such that [`IsSimplifiableReshape`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/constant_folding.cc#L1687-L1742) would trigger `CHECK` failures.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commits [ebc1a2ffe5a7573d905e99bd0ee3568ee07c12c1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ebc1a2ffe5a7573d905e99bd0ee3568ee07c12c1), [1fb27733f943295d874417630edd3b38b34ce082](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1fb27733f943295d874417630edd3b38b34ce082), and [240655511cd3e701155f944a972db71b6c0b1bb6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/240655511cd3e701155f944a972db71b6c0b1bb6).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the Grappler optimizer in TensorFlow to cause a denial of service.", "Triggered CHECK failures in the IsSimplifiableReshape function."]}
