{"description": "Versions 0.8.3 and earlier of `send` are affected by a directory traversal vulnerability. When relying on the root option to restrict file access it may be possible for an application consumer to escape out of the restricted directory and access files in a similarly named directory. \n\nFor example, `static(_dirname + '/public')` would allow access to `_dirname + '/public-restricted'`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.8.4 or later.", "methods": ["Used directory traversal to access restricted files.", "Escaped restricted directory access to access files in a similarly named directory."]}
