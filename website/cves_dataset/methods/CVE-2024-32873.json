{"description": "## Impact\n\nThis advisory has been created to address the following vulnerabilities found in the Evmos codebase and affecting vesting accounts.\n\n### Wrong spendable balance computation\n\nThe spendable balance is not updated properly when delegating vested tokens. The following example help in describing the issue:\n- Given a clawback vesting account with a starting `15M` vesting schedule. The initial spendable balance is `0`.\n- Time passes and `5M` are vested. The spendable balance is now `5M`.\n- The account delegate `5M`. The spendable balance should be `0`, but returns `5M`\n- The account can send `5M` to another account.\n\nThe issue allowed a clawback vesting account to anticipate the release of unvested tokens.\n\n### Missing precompile checks\n\nPreliminary checks on actions computed by the clawback vesting accounts are performed in the ante handler. Evmos core, implements two different ante handlers: one for Cosmos transactions and one for Ethereum transactions. Checks performed on the two implementation are different.\n\nThe vulnerability discovered allowed a clawback account to bypass Cosmos ante handler checks by sending an Ethereum transaction targeting a precompile used to interact with a Cosmos SDK module.\n\n### Missing create validator check\n\nThis vulnerability allowed a user to create a validator using vested tokens to deposit the self-bond.\n\n## Patches\n\n- The spendable balance function has been fixed correcting the `TrackDelegation` function.\n- The checks for the staking module, for the delegation and the create validator, has been moved into the `MsgServer` of a wrapper around the Cosmos SDK staking module. \n\nThe issues have been patched in versions >=V18.0.0.\n\n## References\n1.
