{"description": "Jenkins RQM Plugin 2.8 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows attackers able to provide crafted API responses from Rational Quality Manager to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery. There is currently no known workaround or fix for this issue.", "methods": ["Used XXE attacks to extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.", "Used XXE attacks for server-side request forgery."]}
