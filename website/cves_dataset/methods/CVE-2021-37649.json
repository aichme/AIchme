{"description": "### Impact\nThe code for `tf.raw_ops.UncompressElement` can be made to trigger a null pointer dereference: \n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndata = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensors([0.0])\ntf.raw_ops.UncompressElement(\n  compressed=tf.data.experimental.to_variant(data),\n  output_types=[tf.int64],\n  output_shapes=[2])\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/compression_ops.cc#L50-L53) obtains a pointer to a `CompressedElement` from a `Variant` tensor and then proceeds to dereference it for decompressing. There is no check that the `Variant` tensor contained a `CompressedElement`, so the pointer is actually `nullptr`.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [7bdf50bb4f5c54a4997c379092888546c97c3ebd](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7bdf50bb4f5c54a4997c379092888546c97c3ebd).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Null pointer dereference in `UncompressElement` function.", "Triggering a null pointer dereference by passing a `nullptr` to `tf.raw_ops.UncompressElement`.", "No check for `Variant` tensor containing a `CompressedElement` before dereferencing it."]}
