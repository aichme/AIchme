{"description": "### Impact\nIf FoF Upload is configured to allow the uploading of SVG files (`image/svg+xml`), navigating directly to an SVG file URI could execute arbitrary Javascript code decided by an attacker.\n\nThis Javascript code could include the execution of HTTP web requests to Flarum, or any other web service. This could allow data to be leaked by an authenticated Flarum user, or, possibly, for data to be modified maliciously.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched with v1.2.3, which now sanitizes uploaded SVG files.\n\n### Workarounds\nUpgrade to `1.2.3` (requires Flarum 1.2 or later), or remove the ability for users to upload SVG files through FoF Upload.\n\n### References\nThank you to Safwat Refaat for the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability.\n", "methods": ["Used cross-site scripting (XSS) via unsanitized SVG files.", "Executed arbitrary Javascript code via XSS.", "Executed HTTP web requests to Flarum or other web services via XSS.", "Leaked data via authenticated Flarum user.", "Modified data maliciously via XSS.", "Sanitized uploaded SVG files to prevent XSS."]}
