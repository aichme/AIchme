{"description": "\n### Problem\nDue to improper input validation, attackers can by-pass restrictions of predefined options and submit arbitrary data in the Form Designer backend module of the Form Framework.\n\nIn the default configuration of the Form Framework this allows attackers to explicitly allow arbitrary mime-types for file uploads - however, default _fileDenyPattern_ successfully blocked files like _.htaccess_ or _malicious.php_. Besides that, attackers can persist those files in any writable directory of the corresponding TYPO3 installation.\n\nA valid backend user account with access to the form module is needed to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Richie Lee who reported this issue and to TYPO3 contributor Ralf Zimmermann who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-003](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-003)", "methods": ["Used Broken Access Control to bypass restrictions of predefined options in the Form Designer backend module.", "Used Broken Access Control to submit arbitrary data in the Form Designer backend module.", "Used Broken Access Control to allow arbitrary mime-types for file uploads.", "Used Broken Access Control to persist files in any writable directory of the corresponding TYPO3 installation."]}
