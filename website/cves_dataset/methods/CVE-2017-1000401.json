{"description": "The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier default form control for passwords and other secrets, <f:password/>, supports form validation (e.g. for API keys). The form validation AJAX requests were sent via GET, which could result in secrets being logged to a HTTP access log in non-default configurations of Jenkins, and made available to users with access to these log files. Form validation for <f:password/> is now always sent via POST, which is typically not logged.", "methods": ["Used HTTP GET requests to send form validation AJAX requests.", "Used HTTP access logs to store sensitive information.", "Failed to validate user input for secrets and API keys.", "Used non-default configurations of Jenkins to store sensitive information in logs."]}
