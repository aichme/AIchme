{"description": "### Problem\nThe plaintext value of `$GLOBALS['SYS']['encryptionKey']` was displayed in the editing forms of the TYPO3 Install Tool user interface. This allowed attackers to utilize the value to generate cryptographic hashes used for verifying the authenticity of HTTP request parameters. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrator-level backend user account with system maintainer permissions.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2024-004](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2024-004)\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable application (TYPO3 Install Tool) to disclose sensitive information (encryption key).", "Utilized the disclosed encryption key to generate cryptographic hashes for verifying HTTP request parameters.", "Exploited an administrator-level backend user account with system maintainer permissions to access the vulnerable application."]}
