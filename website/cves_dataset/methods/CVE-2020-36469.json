{"description": "The `appendix` crate implements a key-value mapping data structure called\n`Index<K, V>` that is stored on disk. The crate allows for any type to inhabit\nthe generic `K` and `V` type parameters and implements Send and Sync for them\nunconditionally.\n\nUsing a type that is not marked as `Send` or `Sync` with `Index` can allow it\nto be used across multiple threads leading to data races. Additionally using\nreference types for the keys or values will lead to the segmentation faults\nin the crate's code.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable data structure (Index<K, V>) to cause data races across multiple threads.", "Used reference types for keys or values, leading to segmentation faults.", "Failed to ensure thread safety by not implementing Send and Sync for types used in Index."]}
