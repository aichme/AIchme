{"description": "A regression has been introduced in the commit preventing JMX re-bind. By passing an empty environment map to RMIConnectorServer, instead of the map that contains the authentication credentials, it leaves ActiveMQ open to the following attack - A remote client could create a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean and use it to create new MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no security manager. In other words, a rogue remote client could make your Java application execute arbitrary code. Mitigation - Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.13", "methods": ["Used arbitrary code execution via JMX re-bind.", "Leveraged a vulnerability in a Java application to execute arbitrary code.", "Exploited a regression in a commit to gain remote code execution.", "Created a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean to execute code from arbitrary URLs."]}
