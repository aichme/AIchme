The event would be captured in the Event Log.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in 0.24.0 and 0.23.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor users who are unable to upgrade, we recommend auditing users who have `UserWrite` permissions and regularly reviewing the Event Log for malicious activity.\n\n### Kudos\nThank you to Michael Mazzolini (Ethical Hacker at WHO) for finding and disclosing this vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used a carefully crafted request to create a user with higher privileges.", "Used a malicious proxy to create a user with higher privileges.", "Created a user with higher privileges due to insufficient checks on allowed permissions.", "Used UserWrite permissions to create a user with higher privileges.", "Used Event Log to capture malicious activity.", "Used auditing to review users with UserWrite permissions.", "Used regular review of Event Log for malicious activity."]}
