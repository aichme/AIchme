{"description": "Jenkins Chef Sinatra Plugin 1.20 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins send an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled URL and have it parse the response as XML.\n\nAs the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nAdditionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used a CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins Chef Sinatra Plugin to send HTTP requests to an attacker-controlled URL.", "Used XXE attacks to parse crafted XML responses and extract secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.", "Used a CSRF vulnerability to bypass form validation and execute malicious requests without requiring POST requests."]}
