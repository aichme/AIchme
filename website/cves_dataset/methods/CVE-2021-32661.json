{"description": "### Impact\n\nA malicious internal actor can potentially upload documentation content with malicious scripts by embedding the script within an `object` element. This may give access to sensitive data when other users visit that same documentation page.\n\nThe ability to upload malicious content may be limited by internal code review processes, unless the chosen TechDocs deployment method is to use an object store and the actor has access to upload files directly to that store.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability is patched in the `0.9.5` release of `@backstage/plugin-techdocs`.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\n* Visit our chat, linked to in [Backstage README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\n", "methods": ["Uploads malicious scripts via object element in documentation content.", "Uploads malicious content via object store.", "Uses internal code review processes to bypass upload limitations.", "Uses direct file upload to object store."]}
