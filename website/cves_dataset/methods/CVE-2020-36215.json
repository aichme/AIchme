{"description": "Affected versions of hashconsing implements Send/Sync for its HConsed type without restricting it to Sendable types and Syncable types. This allows non-Sync types such as Cell to be shared across threads leading to undefined behavior and memory corruption in concurrent programs.", "methods": ["Implemented a vulnerable library (hashconsing) in a concurrent program.", "Failed to restrict shared data to thread-safe types.", "Allowed non-thread-safe types (Cell) to be shared across threads.", "Caused undefined behavior and memory corruption."]}
