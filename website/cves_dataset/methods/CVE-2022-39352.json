{"description": "### Overview\nDuring our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions v0.2.4 and prior are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.\n\n### Am I Affected?\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `openfga/openfga` version v0.2.4 or prior, and have tuples where the `user` field is set to a `userset` e.g. `folder:test#owner`, and the tuple's relation is used on the right-hand side of a `from` statement.\n\n### How to fix that?\nUpgrade to version 0.2.5.\n\n### Backward Compatibility\nThis update is not backward compatible.\nAny tuples where the `user` field is set to a `userset`, and the tuple's relation is used on the right-hand side of a `from` statement have to be rewritten.", "methods": ["Used authorization bypass to gain access to unauthorized data.", "Exploited a vulnerability in OpenFGA versions v0.2.4 and prior.", "Used a specific condition to bypass authorization checks (tuples where the `user` field is set to a `userset` and the tuple's relation is used on the right-hand side of a `from` statement)."]}
