{"description": "There is a vulnerability in ActiveStorage's S3 adapter that allows the Content-Length of a direct file upload to be modified by an end user.\n\nVersions Affected:  rails < 5.2.4.2, rails < 6.0.3.1\nNot affected:       Applications that do not use the direct upload functionality of the ActiveStorage S3 adapter.\nFixed Versions:     rails >= 5.2.4.3, rails >= 6.0.3.1\n\nImpact\n------\n\nUtilizing this vulnerability, an attacker can control the Content-Length of an S3 direct upload URL without receiving a new signature from the server. This could be used to bypass controls in place on the server to limit upload size.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\n\nThis is a low-severity security issue. As such, no workaround is necessarily until such time as the application can be upgraded.", "methods": ["Bypassing security controls to upload oversized files.", "Manipulating file upload size limits.", "Exploiting a vulnerability in a web application to upload files."]}
