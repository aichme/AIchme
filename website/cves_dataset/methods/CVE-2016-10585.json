{"description": "Affected versions of `libxl` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `libxl`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe module author recommends installing the bindings using a pinned and verified version of SDK instead of the automated download. More information is available in the modules [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libxl).", "methods": ["Downloads resources over HTTP.", "Intercepts and replaces resources to achieve code execution.", "Uses a vulnerable automated download process."]}
