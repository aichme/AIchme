{"description": "A command injection vulnerability exists in git-interface in the GitHub repository yarkeev/git-interface prior to 2.1.2. If both the git remote and destination directory are provided by user input, then the use of an `--upload-pack` command-line argument feature of git is also supported for `git clone`, which would then allow for any operating system command to be spawned by the attacker.", "methods": ["Command injection via git remote and destination directory user input.", "Execution of arbitrary operating system commands via git."]}
