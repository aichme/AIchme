This allows to inject arbitrary data having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1) and can lead to various attack chains as described below.\n\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007), [CVE-2020-15099](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15099): Potential Privilege Escalation\n  + the database server used for a TYPO3 installation must be accessible for an attacker (either via internet or shared hosting network)\n  + `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (7.5, high)\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2016-013](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2016-013), [CVE-2016-5091](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-5091): Insecure Deserialization & Remote Code Execution\n  + an attacker must have access to at least one Extbase plugin or module action in a TYPO3 installation\n  + `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:F/RL:O/RC:C` (9.1, critical)\n\nThe overall severity of this vulnerability is **high (8.2)** based on mentioned attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user session (authenticated).\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.20 or 10.4.6 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who reported and fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-008](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-008)", "methods": ["Missing required cryptographic step in TYPO3 CMS to generate arbitrary checksums.", "Injection of arbitrary data with a valid HMAC-SHA1.", "Potential privilege escalation via database server access.", "Insecure deserialization of Extbase plugin or module action.", "Remote code execution via Extbase plugin or module action.", "Use of a valid backend user session for authenticated access."]}
