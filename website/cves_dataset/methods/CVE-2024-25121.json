{"description": "### Problem\nEntities of the File Abstraction Layer (FAL) could be persisted directly via `DataHandler`. This allowed attackers to reference files in the fallback storage directly and retrieve their file names and contents. The fallback storage (\"zero-storage\") is used as a backward compatibility layer for files located outside properly configured file storages and within the public web root directory. Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account.\n\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1 that fix the problem described.\n\n#### \u2139\ufe0f Strong security defaults - Manual actions required\n\nWhen persisting entities of the File Abstraction Layer directly via DataHandler, `sys_file` entities are now denied by default, and `sys_file_reference` & `sys_file_metadata` entities are not permitted to reference files in the fallback storage anymore.\n\nWhen importing data from secure origins, this must be explicitly enabled in the corresponding DataHandler instance by using `$dataHandler->isImporting = true;`.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to TYPO3 core & security team member Oliver Hader who reported and fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2024-006](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2024-006)\n", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in the File Abstraction Layer (FAL) via DataHandler to persist entities directly.", "Used a valid backend user account to exploit the vulnerability.", "Exploited a backward compatibility layer for files located outside properly configured file storages and within the public web root directory.", "Used the fallback storage (\"zero-storage\") to retrieve file names and contents.", "Used DataHandler to import data from secure origins, requiring explicit enabling of the import feature.", "Denied sys_file entities by default and restricted sys_file_reference and sys_file_metadata entities from referencing files in the fallback storage."]}
