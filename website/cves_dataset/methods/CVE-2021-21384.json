{"description": "### Impact\n\nAnyone using _Shescape_ to defend against shell injection may still be vulnerable against shell injection if the attacker manages to insert a [null character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character) into the payload. For example (on Windows):\n\n```javascript\nconst cp = require(\"child_process\");\nconst shescape = require(\"shescape\");\n\nconst nullChar = String.fromCharCode(0);\nconst payload = \"foo\\\" && ls -al ${nullChar} && echo \\\"bar\";\nconsole.log(cp.execSync(`echo ${shescape.quote(payload)}`));\n// foototal 3\n// drwxr-xr-x 1 owner XXXXXX      0 Mar 13 18:44 .\n// drwxr-xr-x 1 owner XXXXXX      0 Mar 13 00:09 ..\n// drwxr-xr-x 1 owner XXXXXX      0 Mar 13 18:42 folder                                                                 \n// -rw-r--r-- 1 owner XXXXXX      0 Mar 13 18:42 file\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in [v1.1.3](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape/releases/tag/v1.1.3) which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAlternatively, null characters can be stripped out manually using e.g. `arg.replace(/\\u{0}/gu, \"\")`", "methods": ["Used null characters in shell injection attacks to bypass defenses.", "Used shell injection to execute commands, e.g. \"ls -al\" and \"echo\".", "Used a vulnerability in the Shescape library to inject malicious commands.", "Used a null character to inject malicious commands into the Shescape library.", "Used a workaround to strip out null characters from input, e.g. \"arg.replace(/\\u{0}/gu, \"\")\"."]}
