{"description": "### Impact\nThe `CKEditor.HTMLConverter` document lacked a protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), allowing to execute macros with the rights of the current user. If a privileged user with programming rights was tricked into executing a GET request to this document with certain parameters (e.g., via an image with a corresponding URL embedded in a comment or via a redirect), this would allow arbitrary remote code execution and the attacker could gain rights, access private information or impact the availability of the wiki.\n\nThe attack can be demonstrated by accessing the URL `<server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main?sheet=CKEditor.HTMLConverter&language=en&sourceSyntax=xwiki%2F2.1&stripHTMLEnvelope=true&fromHTML=false&toHTML=true&text=%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dprintln%28%22Hello+from+Groovy%21%22%29%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D` where `<server>` is the URL of the XWiki installation as a user with programming rights. If this displays the text \"Hello from Groovy!\", the installation is vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched in the CKEditor Integration version 1.64.3. This has also been patched in the version of the CKEditor integration that is bundled starting with XWiki 14.6 RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds for this other than upgrading the CKEditor integration to a fixed version.\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/xwiki-contrib/application-ckeditor/commit/6b1053164386aefc526df7512bc664918aa6849b\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CKEDITOR-475\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Used Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to execute macros with the rights of the current user.", "Executed arbitrary remote code via a GET request.", "Used a Groovy script to execute code on the server.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the CKEditor.HTMLConverter document."]}
