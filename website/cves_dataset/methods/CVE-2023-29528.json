{"description": "### Impact\nThe \"restricted\" mode of the HTML cleaner in XWiki, introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1 and massively improved in version 14.6-rc-1, allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site scripting via invalid HTML comments. As a consequence, any code relying on this \"restricted\" mode for security is vulnerable to JavaScript injection (\"cross-site scripting\"/XSS). An example are anonymous comments in XWiki where the HTML macro filters HTML using restricted mode:\n\n```html\n{{html}}\n<!--> <Details Open OnToggle=confirm(\"XSS\")>\n{{/html}}\n```\n\nWhen a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in XWiki, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the XWiki instance.\n\nNote that while all versions since 4.2-milestone-1 should be vulnerable, only starting with version 14.6-rc-1 the HTML comment is necessary for the attack to succeed due to [another vulnerability](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/security/advisories/GHSA-m3jr-cvhj-f35j) that has been patched in version 14.6-rc-1.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10, HTML comments are now removed in restricted mode and a check has been introduced that ensures that comments don't start with `>`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the fix.\n\n### References\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2568\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20348\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/8ff1a9d7e5d7b45b690134a537d53dc05cae04ab\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [XWiki Security mailing-list](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n\n### Attribution\n\nThis vulnerability was reported on Intigriti by [ynoof](https://twitter.com/ynoofAssiri) @Ynoof5.\n", "methods": ["Injected arbitrary HTML code via invalid HTML comments in XWiki's \"restricted\" mode.", "Executed JavaScript code in the context of a user session.", "Exploited a vulnerability in XWiki versions 4.2-milestone-1 to 14.9.", "Used HTML comments to bypass a security check in XWiki version 14.6-rc-1.", "Removed HTML comments in restricted mode to prevent exploitation.", "Introduced a check to ensure comments don't start with '>' in XWiki version 14.10."]}
