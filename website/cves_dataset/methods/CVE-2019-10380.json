This results in arbitrary code execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the Jenkins Simple Travis Pipeline Runner Plugin to bypass sandbox protection.", "Executed arbitrary code on a Jenkins instance with the plugin installed.", "Exploited a script sandbox protection bypass vulnerability."]}
