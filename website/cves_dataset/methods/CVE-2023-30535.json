An attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted connection URL, the user\u2019s local machine would render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution.", "methods": ["Used a malicious, publicly accessible server to respond to SSO URL with an attack payload.", "Tricked a user into visiting a maliciously crafted connection URL.", "Executed remote code execution on a user's local machine."]}
