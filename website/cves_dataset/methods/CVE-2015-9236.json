{"description": "Versions of `hapi` prior to 11.0.0 implement CORS incorrectly, allowing for configurations that at best return inconsistent headers, and at worst allow cross-origin activities that are expected to be forbidden. \n\nIf the connection has CORS enabled but one route has it off, and the route is not GET, the OPTIONS prefetch request will return the default CORS headers and then the actual request will go through and return no CORS headers. This defeats the purpose of turning CORS on the route.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 11.0.0 or later.", "methods": ["Incorrectly implemented CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in hapi, allowing cross-origin activities that are expected to be forbidden.", "Inconsistent handling of CORS preflight request headers in hapi, returning default CORS headers and then allowing requests to proceed without CORS headers."]}
