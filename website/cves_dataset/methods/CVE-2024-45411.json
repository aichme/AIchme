{"description": "### Description\n\nUnder some circumstances, the sandbox security checks are not run which allows user-contributed templates to bypass the sandbox restrictions.\n\nThe security issue happens when all these conditions are met:\n\n * The sandbox is disabled globally;\n * The sandbox is enabled via a sandboxed `include()` function which references a template name (like `included.twig`) and not a `Template` or `TemplateWrapper` instance;\n * The included template has been loaded before the `include()` call but in a non-sandbox context (possible as the sandbox has been globally disabled).\n\n### Resolution\n\nThe patch ensures that the sandbox security checks are always run at runtime.\n\n### Credits\n\nWe would like to thank Fabien Potencier for reporting and fixing the issue.\n", "methods": ["Bypasses security checks by exploiting a sandbox configuration vulnerability.", "Exploits a misconfigured sandbox to execute malicious code.", "Uses a vulnerability in a web application to execute arbitrary code."]}
