{"description": "### Impact\nThere are two separate code paths in which memory can be allocated per message in excess of the `grpc.max_receive_message_length` channel option:\n\n 1. If an incoming message has a size on the wire greater than the configured limit, the entire message is buffered before it is discarded.\n 2. If an incoming message has a size within the limit on the wire but decompresses to a size greater than the limit, the entire message is decompressed into memory, and on the server is not discarded.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in versions 1.10.9, 1.9.15, and 1.8.22\n", "methods": ["Can allocate memory for incoming messages well above configured limits.", "Can buffer entire messages in memory before discarding.", "Can decompress messages into memory without limits.", "Can bypass configured receive message length limits."]}
