{"description": "### Summary\nThe `WriteBind()` method in `src/Npgsql/Internal/NpgsqlConnector.FrontendMessages.cs` uses `int` variables to store the message length and the sum of parameter lengths. Both variables overflow when the sum of parameter lengths becomes too large.\n\nThis causes Npgsql to write a message size that is too small when constructing a Postgres protocol message to send it over the network to the database. When parsing the message, the database will only read a small number of bytes and treat any following bytes as new messages while they belong to the old message.\n\nAttackers can abuse this to inject arbitrary Postgres protocol messages into the connection, leading to the execution of arbitrary SQL statements on the application's behalf.\n\n### Impact\nAttackers can issue arbitrary SQL statements to the database on behalf of the application. The final impact depends on the application that uses Npgsql, the data it stores in Postgres, etc.", "methods": ["Injects arbitrary SQL statements into the database.", "Executes arbitrary SQL statements on the application's behalf.", "Abuses protocol message size overflow to inject malicious messages.", "Uses SQL injection to execute malicious SQL statements."]}
