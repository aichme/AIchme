{"description": "### Impact\n\nAll users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 <= 6.4.1` does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend is using the `xmlsec1` binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default, `xmlsec1` accepts any type of key found within the given document. `xmlsec1` needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to pysaml2 `v6.5.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround provided at this point.\n\n### References\n\nThis issue has been reported in the past at the xmlsec1 mailing list:\nhttps://www.aleksey.com/pipermail/xmlsec/2013/009717.html\n\n### Credits\n\n- Brian Wolff\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [pysaml2](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2)\n* Email us at [the incident-response address](mailto:incident-response@idpy.org)\n", "methods": ["Impacts the verification of cryptographic signatures in PySAML2.", "Fails to ensure correct verification of signed SAML documents.", "Uses the xmlsec1 binary to verify signatures, but accepts any type of key by default.", "Requires explicit configuration to only use x509 certificates for verification."]}
