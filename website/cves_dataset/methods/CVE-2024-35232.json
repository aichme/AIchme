{"description": "### Summary\naccess_token can be exposed in error message on fail in HTTP request.\n\n### Details\nUsing this module, when HTTP request fails, error message can contain access_token. This can be happen when:\n- module is sending HTTP request with query parameter `?access_token=...`.\n- and HTTP request fails (errors like `facebook: cannot reach facebook server`).\n\nIn such situation, error message is constucted like following.\nhttps://github.com/huandu/facebook/blob/1591be276561bbdb019c0279f1d33cb18a650e1b/session.go#L558-L567\nOriginal error message contained in it comes from `net/http` module. And it can contain full URL, that can contain query parameter `access_token`:\nhttps://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.22.3:src/net/http/client.go;l=629-633\nhttps://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.22.3:src/net/url/url.go;l=30\n\nIt should be very common that applications log error message when they encounter errors. As a result, access_token can be stored into log server and some other infrastructures. Of course other careless error handling in client code that causing other security problems can exist.\n\nI'm not very sure that whether we can consider that github.com/huandu/facebook is vulnerable. Anyway, I think current error message, that can expose access_token, is not desirble.\n\n### PoC\nRequest me this section if you need complete instruction.\n\n### Impact\nClient applications with following conditions can be affected.\n- logs error message from this module\n- or returns error message to client as something like HTTP response.\n- or uses error messages somewhere\n", "methods": ["Exposes access_token in error message on HTTP request failure.", "Logs error messages that may contain access_token.", "Returns error messages to clients that may contain access_token.", "Uses error messages in client code that may contain access_token."]}
