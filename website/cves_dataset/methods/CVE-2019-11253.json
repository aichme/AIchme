{"description": "Improper input validation in the Kubernetes API server in versions v1.0-1.12 and versions prior to v1.13.12, v1.14.8, v1.15.5, and v1.16.2 allows authorized users to send malicious YAML or JSON payloads, causing the API server to consume excessive CPU or memory, potentially crashing and becoming unavailable. Prior to v1.14.0, default RBAC policy authorized anonymous users to submit requests that could trigger this vulnerability. Clusters upgraded from a version prior to v1.14.0 keep the more permissive policy by default for backwards compatibility.\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\nk8s.io/kubernetes/pkg/apiserver", "methods": ["Sent malicious YAML or JSON payloads to the Kubernetes API server.", "Exploited improper input validation in the Kubernetes API server.", "Caused the API server to consume excessive CPU or memory.", "Triggered the API server to crash and become unavailable.", "Exploited default RBAC policy for anonymous users.", "Exploited backwards compatibility in clusters upgraded from a version prior to v1.14.0."]}
