{"description": "### Impact\nIf users expose the apollo-configservice to the internet (which is not recommended), there are potential security issues since there is no authentication feature enabled for the built-in eureka service. Malicious hackers may access eureka directly to mock apollo-configservice and apollo-adminservice .\n\n### Patches\nLogin authentication for eureka was added in https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/pull/4663 and was released in [v2.1.0](https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/releases/tag/v2.1.0).\n\n### Workarounds\nTo fix the potential issue without upgrading, simply follow the advice that does not expose apollo-configservice to the internet.\n\n### References\n[Apollo Security Guidence](https://www.apolloconfig.com/#/en/usage/apollo-user-guide?id=_71-security-related)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [issue](https://github.com/apolloconfig/apollo/issues)\n* Email us at [apollo-config@googlegroups.com](mailto:apollo-config@googlegroups.com)\n", "methods": ["Exposed a service to the internet without authentication.", "Lack of authentication feature for a built-in service."]}
