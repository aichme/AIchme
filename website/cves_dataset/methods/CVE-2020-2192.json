{"description": "Swarm Plugin adds API endpoints to add or remove agent labels. In Swarm Plugin 3.20 and earlier these only require a global Swarm secret to use, and no regular permission check is performed. This allows users with Agent/Create permission to add or remove labels of any agent.\n\nAdditionally, these API endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nSwarm Plugin 3.21 requires POST requests and Agent/Configure permission for the affected agent to these endpoints. It no longer uses the global Swarm secret for these API endpoints.", "methods": ["Used a CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins Swarm Plugin API endpoints.", "Added or removed agent labels without permission checks.", "Used a global Swarm secret without permission checks.", "Required POST requests for affected API endpoints.", "Required Agent/Configure permission for affected agents.", "Removed the use of global Swarm secret for API endpoints."]}
