{"description": "### Impact\n\nWhen users update their passwords, the new credentials may be briefly held in the server database. While this doesn't grant the server any added capabilities\u2014it already learns the users' passwords as part of the authentication process\u2014it does disrupt the expectation that passwords won't be stored in the database. As a result, these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database backups for a longer duration.\n\nThese temporarily stored passwords are automatically erased after a 48-hour window.\n\n### Patches\nhttps://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16272\n\n### References\n\nThis bug was due to a regression in https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13188.", "methods": ["Temporarily stored plaintext passwords in the server database.", "Disrupted expectation of password security.", "Inadvertently captured passwords in database backups.", "Passwords automatically erased after 48-hour window."]}
