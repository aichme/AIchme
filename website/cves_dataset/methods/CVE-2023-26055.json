{"description": "### Impact\nAny user can edit his own profile and inject code which is going to be executed with programming right.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n* Set your first name to\n\n```\n    {{cache id=\"userProfile\"}}{{groovy}}println(\"Hello from groovy!\"){{/groovy}}{{/cache}}\n```\n\nThe first name appears as interpreted \"`Hello from groovy`\" instead of the expected fully escaped \"`{{cache id=\"userProfile\"}}{{groovy}}println(\"Hello from groovy!\"){{/groovy}}{{/cache}}`\".\n\nThe same vulnerability can also be exploited in all other places where short text properties are displayed, e.g., in apps created using [Apps Within Minutes](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/App%20Within%20Minutes%20Application) that use a short text field.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched on versions 13.10.9, 14.4.4, 14.7RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no other workarounds than upgrading XWiki or patching the xwiki-commons-xml JAR file.\n\n### References\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19793\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19794\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XCOMMONS-2498\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Injects code via user input (first name field).", "Executes code with programming rights.", "Uses Groovy scripting to execute code.", "Uses cache to store and execute code.", "Uses short text properties to inject code.", "Uses Apps Within Minutes to inject code.", "Uses XWiki Platform to inject code."]}
