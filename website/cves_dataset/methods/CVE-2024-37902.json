{"description": "## Summary\n\nDeepJavaLibrary(DJL) versions 0.1.0 through 0.27.0 do not prevent absolute path archived artifacts from inserting archived files directly into the system, overwriting system files. This is fixed in DJL 0.28.0 and patched in DJL Large Model Inference containers 0.27.0.\n\n**Impacted versions: 0.1.0 through 0.27.0**\n\n## Patches\n\nPatched Deep Learning Containers:\n[v1.1-djl-0.27.0-inf-cpu-full](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases/tag/v1.1-djl-0.27.0-inf-cpu-full)\n[v1.4-djl-0.27.0-inf-ds-0.12.6](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases/tag/v1.4-djl-0.27.0-inf-ds-0.12.6)\n[v1.4-djl-0.27.0-inf-trt-0.8.0](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases/tag/v1.4-djl-0.27.0-inf-trt-0.8.0)\n[v1.3-djl-0.27.0-inf-neuronx-sdk2.18.1](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/releases/tag/v1.3-djl-0.27.0-inf-neuronx-sdk2.18.1)\n\nPatched Library:\n[v0.28.0](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl/releases/tag/v0.28.0)\n", "methods": ["Absolute path traversal via archived artifacts.", "Overwriting system files."]}
