{"description": "### Impact\nApps using both `contextIsolation` and `contextBridge` are affected.\n\nThis is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no app-side workarounds, you must update your Electron version to be protected.\n\n### Fixed Versions\n* `9.0.0-beta.21`\n* `8.2.4`\n* `7.2.4`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org)", "methods": ["Context isolation bypass via contextBridge in Electron.", "Update Electron version to be protected.", "No app-side workarounds available."]}
