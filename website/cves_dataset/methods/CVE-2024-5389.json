{"description": "In lunary-ai/lunary version 1.2.13, an insufficient granularity of access control vulnerability allows users to create, update, get, and delete prompt variations for datasets not owned by their organization. This issue arises due to the application not properly validating the ownership of dataset prompts and their variations against the organization or project of the requesting user. As a result, unauthorized modifications to dataset prompts can occur, leading to altered or removed dataset prompts without proper authorization. This vulnerability impacts the integrity and consistency of dataset information, potentially affecting the results of experiments.", "methods": ["Impersonation: Unauthorized users can create, update, get, and delete prompt variations for datasets not owned by their organization.", "Lateral Movement: Unauthorized modifications to dataset prompts can occur, affecting the results of experiments.", "Privilege Escalation: Unauthorized users can make changes to dataset prompts without proper authorization.", "Data Manipulation: Unauthorized modifications to dataset prompts can occur, leading to altered or removed dataset prompts.", "Persistence: Unauthorized changes to dataset prompts can persist, affecting the integrity and consistency of dataset information."]}
