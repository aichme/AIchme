{"description": "Jenkins Black Duck Detect Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins, and to cause Jenkins to submit HTTP requests to attacker-specified URLs.\n\nAdditionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.\n\nThese form validation methods now require POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the Jenkins Black Duck Detect Plugin to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs.", "Captured credentials stored in Jenkins.", "Caused Jenkins to submit HTTP requests to attacker-specified URLs.", "Exploited a CSRF vulnerability in the Jenkins Black Duck Detect Plugin.", "Used a lack of permission checks to perform unauthorized actions."]}
