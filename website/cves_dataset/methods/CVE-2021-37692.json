{"description": "### Impact\nUnder certain conditions, Go code can trigger a segfault in string deallocation.\n\n\nFor string tensors, `C.TF_TString_Dealloc` is called during garbage collection within a finalizer function.  However, tensor structure isn't checked until encoding to avoid a performance penalty.  The current method for dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to mismatched dimensions).\n\nTo fix this, the call to set the finalizer function is deferred until `NewTensor` returns and, if encoding failed for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8721ba96e5760c229217b594f6d2ba332beedf22](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8721ba96e5760c229217b594f6d2ba332beedf22) (merging [#50508](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/50508)).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, which is the other affected version.                                                                                                                                               \n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported externally via a [fixing PR](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/50508).", "methods": ["None."]}
