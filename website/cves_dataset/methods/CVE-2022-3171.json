{"description": "## Summary\nA potential Denial of Service issue in `protobuf-java` core and lite was discovered in the parsing procedure for binary and text format data. Input streams containing multiple instances of non-repeated [embedded messages](http://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#embedded) with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. \n\nReporter: [OSS Fuzz](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=48771)\n\nAffected versions: This issue affects both the Java full and lite Protobuf runtimes, as well as Protobuf for Kotlin and JRuby, which themselves use the Java Protobuf runtime.\n\n## Severity\n\n[CVE-2022-3171](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-3171) Medium - CVSS Score: 5.7 (NOTE: there may be a delay in publication)\n\n## Remediation and Mitigation\n\nPlease update to the latest available versions of the following packages:\n\nprotobuf-java (3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6, 3.16.3)\nprotobuf-javalite (3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6, 3.16.3)\nprotobuf-kotlin (3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6, 3.16.3)\nprotobuf-kotlin-lite (3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6, 3.16.3)\ngoogle-protobuf [JRuby gem only] (3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6)\n", "methods": ["None of the techniques are mentioned in the description."]}
