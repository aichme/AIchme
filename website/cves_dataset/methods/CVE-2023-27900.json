This library is used to process uploaded files via the Stapler web framework (usually through StaplerRequest#getFile) and MultipartFormDataParser in Jenkins.\n\nThis allows attackers to cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending crafted requests to HTTP endpoints processing file uploads.\n\nJenkins 2.394, LTS 2.375.4, and LTS 2.387.1 limits the number of request parts to be processed to 1000. Specific endpoints receiving only simple form submissions have a lower limit.", "methods": ["Used crafted HTTP requests to cause a denial of service (DoS).", "Exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Commons FileUpload library.", "Used Stapler web framework to process uploaded files.", "Used MultipartFormDataParser to process file uploads."]}
