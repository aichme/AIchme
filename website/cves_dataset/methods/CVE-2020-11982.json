When using CeleryExecutor, if an attack can connect to the broker (Redis, RabbitMQ) directly, it was possible to insert a malicious payload directly to the broker which could lead to a deserialization attack (and thus remote code execution) on the Worker.", "methods": ["Used a deserialization attack to achieve remote code execution.", "Exploited an insecure default configuration of Apache Airflow.", "Used a direct connection to the broker (Redis, RabbitMQ) to insert a malicious payload."]}
