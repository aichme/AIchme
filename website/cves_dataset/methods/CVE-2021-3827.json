{"description": "### Description\nA flaw was found in keycloak, where the default ECP binding flow allows other authentication flows to be bypassed. By exploiting this behavior an attacker can bypass the MFA authentication by sending a SOAP request with an AuthnRequest and Authorization header with the user's credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.\n", "methods": ["Bypassed authentication flows using SOAP requests.", "Sent a request with AuthnRequest and Authorization header with user's credentials.", "Exploited default ECP binding flow."]}
