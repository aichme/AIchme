{"description": "An issue was discovered in fastecdsa before 2.1.2. When using the NIST P-256 curve in the ECDSA implementation, the point at infinity is mishandled. This means that for an extreme value in k and s<sup>-1</sup>, the signature verification fails even if the signature is correct. This behavior is not solely a usability problem. There are some threat models where an attacker can benefit by successfully guessing users for whom signature verification will fail.", "methods": ["Attempted to bypass security controls through exploitation of a vulnerability in the cryptographic signature verification process.", "Exploited a weakness in the ECDSA implementation on the NIST P-256 curve.", "Attempted to guess user credentials to bypass security controls."]}
