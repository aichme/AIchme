{"description": "### Impact\nWhen an admin disables a user account, the user's profile is executed with the admin's rights. This allows a user to place malicious code in the user profile before getting an admin to disable the user account.\n\nTo reproduce, as a user without script nor programming rights, edit the about section of your user profile and add `{{groovy}}services.logging.getLogger(\"attacker\").error(\"Hello from Groovy!\"){{/groovy}}`.\nAs an admin, go to the user profile and click the \"Disable this account\" button.\nThen, reload the page. If the logs show `attacker - Hello from Groovy!` then the instance is vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.10.21, 15.5.5, 15.10.6 and 16.0.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nWe're not aware of any workaround except upgrading.\n\n### References\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21611\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/f89c8f47fad6e5cc7e68c69a7e0acde07f5eed5a\n", "methods": ["Executed malicious code from a user account with admin rights.", "Used a web application vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.", "Used a web application to inject malicious code into a user profile.", "Executed Groovy code from a user profile.", "Used a web application to execute a payload from a user account."]}
