{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe velocity scripts is not properly sandboxed against using the Java File API to perform read or write operations on the filesystem. Now writing an attacking script in velocity requires the Script rights in XWiki so not all users can use it, and it also requires finding an XWiki API which returns a File. \n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched on versions 12.6.7, 12.10.3 and 13.0RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere's no easy workaround for fixing this vulnerability other than upgrading and being careful when giving Script rights.\n\n### References\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-5168\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [XWiki Security mailing-list](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Used the Java File API to perform arbitrary filesystem write access.", "Leveraged the XWiki API to read or write files.", "Required Script rights in XWiki to execute scripts.", "Required finding an XWiki API that returns a File object."]}
