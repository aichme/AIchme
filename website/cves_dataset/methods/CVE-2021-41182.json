{"description": "### Impact\nAccepting the value of the `altField` option of the Datepicker widget from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. For example, initializing the datepicker in the following way:\n```js\n$( \"#datepicker\" ).datepicker( {\n\taltField: \"<img onerror='doEvilThing()' src='/404' />\",\n} );\n```\nwill call the `doEvilThing` function.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to the `altField` option is now treated as a CSS selector.\n\n### Workarounds\nA workaround is to not accept the value of the `altField` option from untrusted sources.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, search for a relevant issue in [the jQuery UI repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/issues).
