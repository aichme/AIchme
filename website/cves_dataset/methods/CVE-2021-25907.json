{"description": "Upon panic in a user-provided function f, fn mutate() & fn mutate2 drops twice a same object.\n\nAffected versions of this crate did not guard against double drop while temporarily duplicating an object's ownership with ptr::read().\n\nDropping a same object can result in memory corruption.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version \"0.9.11\" by fixing the code to abort upon panic.", "methods": ["Used double free vulnerability in a user-provided function.", "Executed code that results in memory corruption."]}
