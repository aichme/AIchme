{"description": "### Impact\nZITADEL's user account deactivation mechanism did not work correctly with service accounts. Deactivated service accounts retained the ability to request tokens, which could lead to unauthorized access to applications and resources.\n\n### Patches\n\n2.x versions are fixed on >= [2.62.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.62.1)\n2.61.x versions are fixed on >= [2.61.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.61.1)\n2.60.x versions are fixed on >= [2.60.2](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.60.2)\n2.59.x versions are fixed on >= [2.59.3](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.59.3)\n2.58.x versions are fixed on >= [2.58.5](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.58.5)\n2.57.x versions are fixed on >= [2.57.5](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.57.5)\n2.56.x versions are fixed on >= [2.56.6](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.56.6)\n2.55.x versions are fixed on >= [2.55.8](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.55.8)\n2.54.x versions are fixed on >= [2.54.10](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.54.10)\n\n### Workarounds\nInstead of deactivating the service account, consider creating new credentials and replacing the old ones wherever they are used. This effectively prevents the deactivated service account from being utilized.\n\n- Revoke all existing authentication keys associated with the service account\n- Rotate the service account's password\n\n### Questions\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at \n\n[security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in ZITADEL's user account deactivation mechanism to retain access to applications and resources.", "Exploited a flaw in ZITADEL's service account management to request tokens despite being deactivated.", "Used service accounts to gain unauthorized access to applications and resources.", "Failed to properly revoke authentication keys associated with a service account.", "Failed to properly rotate a service account's password."]}
