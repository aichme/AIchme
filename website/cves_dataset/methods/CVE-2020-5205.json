{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe use of `Plug.Session` in `Pow.Plug.Session` is susceptible to session fixation attacks if a persistent session store is used for `Plug.Session`, such as Redis or a database. Cookie store, which is used in most Phoenix apps, doesn't have this vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nCall `Plug.Conn.configure_session(conn, renew: true)` periodically and after privilege change. A custom authorization plug can be written where the `create/3` method should return the `conn` only after `Plug.Conn.configure_session/2` have been called on it.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/danschultzer/pow/commit/578ffd3d8bb8e8a26077b644222186b108da474f  \nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Session_fixation", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable library (Plug.Session) in Pow.Plug.Session.", "Used a persistent session store (Redis or database) for Plug.Session.", "Failed to call Plug.Conn.configure_session(conn, renew: true) periodically.", "Failed to call Plug.Conn.configure_session(conn, renew: true) after privilege change."]}
