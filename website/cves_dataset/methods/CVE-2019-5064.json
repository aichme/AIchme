{"description": "An exploitable heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the data structure persistence functionality of OpenCV, version 4.1.0 (corresponds with OpenCV-Python version 4.1.2.30). A specially crafted JSON file can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in multiple heap corruptions and potentially code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted file to trigger this vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used a specially crafted JSON file to trigger a heap buffer overflow.", "Executed arbitrary code through heap corruption.", "Manipulated the data structure of OpenCV to cause a buffer overflow."]}
