{"description": "### Impact\n\nIf you use [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth) (i.e. the `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes) for HTTP authentication, all requests will expose your credentials to the request target.\n\nThis includes requests generated by Scrapy components, such as `robots.txt` requests sent by Scrapy when the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting is set to `True`, or as requests reached through redirects.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to Scrapy 2.5.1 and use the new `http_auth_domain` spider attribute to control which domains are allowed to receive the configured HTTP authentication credentials.\n\nIf you are using Scrapy 1.8 or a lower version, and upgrading to Scrapy 2.5.1 is not an option, you may upgrade to Scrapy 1.8.1 instead.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade, set your HTTP authentication credentials on a per-request basis, using for example the [`w3lib.http.basic_auth_header`](https://w3lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/w3lib.html#w3lib.http.basic_auth_header) function to convert your credentials into a value that you can assign to the `Authorization` header of your request, instead of defining your credentials globally using [`HttpAuthMiddleware`](http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#module-scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpauth).\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* [Open an issue](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/issues)\n* [Email us](mailto:opensource@zyte.com)\n", "methods": ["Leaked HTTP authentication credentials to target websites.", "Used global HTTP authentication credentials.", "Used global HTTP authentication credentials for requests generated by Scrapy components.", "Used global HTTP authentication credentials for robots.txt requests.", "Used global HTTP authentication credentials for requests reached through redirects."]}
