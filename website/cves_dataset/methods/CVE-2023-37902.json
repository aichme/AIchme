{"description": "### Impact\nthe ecrecover precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not verify, see https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/b058cf454b3bdc7e770e2b3cec83a0bcb48f55ee/core/vm/contracts.go#L188. however, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is at memory location 0.\n\nthis means that the if the compiler has been convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an invalid signature.\n\nA contract search was performed. Most uses of `ecrecover` are used for erc2612-style permit implementations, which typically look like:\n\n```vyper\n    assert _owner != empty(address)\n    assert block.timestamp <= _deadline\n                  \n    nonce: uint256 = self.nonces[_owner]\n    digest: bytes32 = keccak256(\n        concat(   \n            b\"\\x19\\x01\",\n            self.DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,\n            keccak256(_abi_encode(PERMIT_TYPEHASH, _owner, _spender, _value, nonce, _deadline))\n        )         \n    )             \n    assert ecrecover(digest, convert(_v, uint256), convert(_r, uint256), convert(_s, uint256)) == _owner\n```\n\nin this case, the immutable `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is loaded into `ecrecover`'s output buffer right before `ecrecover()`, and so the output of `ecrecover()` here when the signature is invalid will be the value of `PERMIT_TYPEHASH`. in this case, since `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` is not a valid address, it will never compare `==` to `_owner`, and so the behaviour is exactly the same as if `ecrecover()` returned 0 in this case.\n\nin general, a contract could have unexpected behavior (i.e. mistakenly pass this style of signature check) if an immutable representing a real address (ex. `OWNER`) was read right before the `ecrecover` operation.\n\n### Patches\nv0.3.10 (with 019a37ab98ff53f04fecfadf602b6cd5ac748f7f and #3586)\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n", "methods": ["The ecrecover function can return undefined data if the signature does not verify, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.", "A contract can be tricked into passing a signature check if an immutable representing a real address is read right before the ecrecover operation.", "The ecrecover function can be used to return a value from memory location 0, potentially allowing an attacker to control the output.", "A contract search revealed most uses of ecrecover are used for erc2612-style permit implementations, which can be vulnerable to this issue."]}
