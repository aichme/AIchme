{"description": "### Impact\nTensorFlow's [type inference](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/core/graph/graph.cc#L223-L229) can cause a heap OOB read as the bounds checking is done in a `DCHECK` (which is a no-op during production):\n\n```cc\nif (node_t.type_id() != TFT_UNSET) {\n  int ix = input_idx[i];\n  DCHECK(ix < node_t.args_size())\n      << \"input \" << i << \" should have an output \" << ix\n      << \" but instead only has \" << node_t.args_size()\n      << \" outputs: \" << node_t.DebugString();\n  input_types.emplace_back(node_t.args(ix));\n  // ...\n}       \n```   \n      \nAn attacker can control `input_idx` such that `ix` would be larger than the number of values in `node_t.args`.\n        \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c99d98cd189839dcf51aee94e7437b54b31f8abd](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c99d98cd189839dcf51aee94e7437b54b31f8abd).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["An attacker can cause a heap OOB read by manipulating the `input_idx` variable.", "An attacker can control the bounds checking by exploiting the `DCHECK` no-op in production."]}
