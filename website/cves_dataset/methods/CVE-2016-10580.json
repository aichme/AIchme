{"description": "Affected versions of `nodewebkit` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `nodewebkit`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available, and the package author has deprecated this package. \n\nThe best path forward in mitigating this vulnerability is to use the [official installer](https://www.npmjs.com/nw) instead of this package, as per the package author's instructions.", "methods": ["Intercept and Replace (T1189)", "Lateral Movement (T1210)"]}
