{"description": "In Apache Qpid Broker-J versions 6.1.0 through 6.1.4 (inclusive) the broker does not properly enforce a maximum frame size in AMQP 1.0 frames. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this to cause the broker to exhaust all available memory and eventually terminate.  Older AMQP protocols are not affected.", "methods": ["Consumes excessive system resources to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).", "Exploits a vulnerability in a service to cause a Denial of Service (DoS)."]}
