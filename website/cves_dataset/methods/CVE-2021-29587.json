{"description": "### Impact\nThe `Prepare` step of the `SpaceToDepth` TFLite operator [does not check for 0 before division](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc/tensorflow/lite/kernels/space_to_depth.cc#L63-L67).\n\n```cc \nconst int block_size = params->block_size;\nconst int input_height = input->dims->data[1];\nconst int input_width = input->dims->data[2];\nint output_height = input_height / block_size;\nint output_width = input_width / block_size;\n```   \n\nAn attacker can craft a model such that `params->block_size` would be zero.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Division by zero in TFLite's implementation of `SpaceToDepth` operator.", "Lack of input validation in `Prepare` step of `SpaceToDepth` TFLite operator."]}
