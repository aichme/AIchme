{"description": "SharpZipLib (or #ziplib) is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library. Prior to version 1.3.3, a TAR file entry `../evil.txt` may be extracted in the parent directory of `destFolder`. This leads to arbitrary file write that may lead to code execution. The vulnerability was patched in version 1.3.3.", "methods": ["Used path traversal to write arbitrary files.", "Executed code through arbitrary file write.", "Leveraged a library vulnerability (SharpZipLib) for exploitation."]}
