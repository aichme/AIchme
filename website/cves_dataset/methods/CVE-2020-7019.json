{"description": "In Elasticsearch before 7.9.0 and 6.8.12 a field disclosure flaw was found when running a scrolling search with Field Level Security.

This could result in an attacker gaining additional permissions against a restricted index.", "methods": ["Leverages field disclosure flaw in Elasticsearch to gain additional permissions against a restricted index.", "Exploits improper privilege management in Elasticsearch."]}
