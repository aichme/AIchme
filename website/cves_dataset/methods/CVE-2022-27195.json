{"description": "Jenkins Parameterized Trigger Plugin 2.43 and earlier captures environment variables passed to builds triggered using Jenkins Parameterized Trigger Plugin, including password parameter values, in their `build.xml` files. These values are stored unencrypted and can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nExisting `build.xml` files are not automatically updated to remove captured environment variables. They need to be manually cleaned up. To help with this, the plugin will report environment variables stored in `build.xml` as unloadable data in the Old Data Monitor, that allows discarding this data. Build records are only loaded from disk when needed however, so some builds stored in Jenkins may not immediately appear there.", "methods": ["Captures sensitive parameter values in build metadata files.", "Stores captured values in unencrypted files.", "Allows users with access to view captured values.", "Fails to remove captured values from existing files.", "Stores build records on disk.", "Loads build records from disk when needed.", "Reports captured values as unloadable data."]}
