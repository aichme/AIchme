{"description": "All versions of com.gradle.plugin-publish before 0.11.0 are vulnerable to Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File. When a plugin author publishes a Gradle plugin while running Gradle with the --info log level flag, the Gradle Logger logs an AWS pre-signed URL. If this build log is publicly visible (as it is in many popular public CI systems like TravisCI) this AWS pre-signed URL would allow a malicious actor to replace a recently uploaded plugin with their own.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable plugin (com.gradle.plugin-publish) to expose sensitive information (AWS pre-signed URL) in a log file.", "Used a public CI system (TravisCI) to make the log file publicly visible.", "Used the --info log level flag to log sensitive information."]}
