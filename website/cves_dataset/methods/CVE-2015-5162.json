{"description": "The image parser in OpenStack Cinder prior to 7.0.2, and 8.0.0 and above, prior to 9.0.0; Glance prior to 14.00; and Nova prior to 12.0.4 does not properly limit qemu-img calls, which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and disk consumption) via a crafted disk image. This issue is patched in Cinder 7.0.2 and 9.0.0; Glance 14.0.0; and Nova 12.0.4", "methods": ["Uncontrolled resource consumption via crafted disk image."]}
