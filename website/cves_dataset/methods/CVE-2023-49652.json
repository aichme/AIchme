{"description": "Jenkins Google Compute Engine Plugin 4.550.vb_327fca_3db_11 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints. This allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to do the following:\n\n- Enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.\n\n- Connect to Google Cloud Platform using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, to obtain information about existing projects.\n\nGoogle Compute Engine Plugin 4.551.v5a_4dc98f6962 requires Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoints.", "methods": ["Enumerated system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.", "Used credentials IDs to connect to Google Cloud Platform.", "Used another vulnerability to capture credentials.", "Used credentials to obtain information about existing projects."]}
