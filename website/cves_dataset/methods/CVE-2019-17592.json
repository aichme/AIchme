{"description": "Versions of `csv-parse` prior to 4.4.6 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service. The `__isInt()` function contains a malformed regular expression that processes large specially-crafted input very slowly, leading to a Denial of Service. This is triggered when using the `cast` option.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 4.4.6 or later.", "methods": ["Uses a malformed regular expression to cause a Denial of Service.", "Exploits a vulnerability in the `csv-parse` library to cause a Denial of Service."]}
