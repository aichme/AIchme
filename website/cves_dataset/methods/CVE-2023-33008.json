{"description": "A malicious attacker can craft up some JSON input that uses large numbers (numbers such as\u00a01e20000000) that Apache Johnzon will deserialize into BigDecimal and maybe use numbers too large which may result in a slow conversion (Denial of service risk). Apache Johnzon 1.2.21 mitigates this by setting a scale limit of 1000 (by default) to the BigDecimal. \n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Johnzon through 1.2.20.\n\n", "methods": ["Used Denial of Service (DoS) to cause a slow conversion of large numbers.", "Used Denial of Service (DoS) to cause a slow conversion of large numbers through untrusted data deserialization."]}
