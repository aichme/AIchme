{"description": "The `active-support` ruby gem gem is malware and duplicates the official `activesupport` (no hyphen) gem, but adds a compiled extension. The extension attempts to resolve a base64 encoded domain (29faea63.planfhntage.de), downloads a payload, and executes.\n \nThis trojan horse gem could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by containing a malicious backdoor. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system.  No version of this gem should be considered safe.", "methods": ["Downloads a payload from a remote domain.", "Executes arbitrary code on the system.", "Uses a malicious backdoor.", "Executes a compiled extension.", "Downloads a payload from a base64 encoded domain.", "Executes a payload."]}
