{"description": "In Eclipse Californium versions 2.0.0 to 2.7.2 and 3.0.0-3.5.0 a DTLS resumption handshake falls back to a DTLS full handshake on a parameter mismatch without using a HelloVerifyRequest. Especially, if used with certificate based cipher suites, that results in message amplification (DDoS other peers) and high CPU load (DoS own peer). The misbehavior occurs only with DTLS_VERIFY_PEERS_ON_RESUMPTION_THRESHOLD values larger than 0.", "methods": ["Uses a protocol mismatch to cause a fallback to a full handshake.", "Causes a denial of service (DoS) on the peer.", "Causes a denial of service (DoS) on other peers through message amplification.", "Causes high CPU load on the peer."]}
