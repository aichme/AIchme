{"description": "### Summary\n\nA XSS vulnerability exists on index pages for static file handling.\n\n### Details\n\nWhen using `web.static(..., show_index=True)`, the resulting index pages do not escape file names.\n\nIf users can upload files with arbitrary filenames to the static directory, the server is vulnerable to XSS attacks.\n\n### Workaround\n\nWe have always recommended using a reverse proxy server (e.g. nginx) for serving static files. Users following the recommendation are unaffected.\n\nOther users can disable `show_index` if unable to upgrade.\n\n-----\n\nPatch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8319/files", "methods": ["Used a web application vulnerability (Cross-site Scripting) to inject malicious scripts.", "Used arbitrary file uploads to the server to inject malicious scripts.", "Used a reverse proxy server (nginx) to prevent exploitation.", "Used a workaround (disabling show_index) to prevent exploitation."]}
