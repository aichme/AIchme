{"description": "The mlflow web server includes tools for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. As this vulnerability allows to write / overwrite any file on the file system, it gives a lot of ways to archive code execution (like overwriting `/home/<user>/.bashrc`). A malicious user could use this issue to get command execution on the vulnerable machine and get access to data & models information.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary file write to overwrite /home/<user>/.bashrc.", "Achieved command execution on the vulnerable machine.", "Gained access to data and models information."]}
