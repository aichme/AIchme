{"description": "### Impact\nThe [`ScatterNd`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/266558ac4c1f361e9a178ee9d3f0ce2e648ae499/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/reference_ops.h#L659-L698) function takes an input argument that determines the indices of of the output tensor. An input index greater than the output tensor or less than zero will either write content at the wrong index or trigger a crash.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b4d4b4cb019bd7240a52daa4ba61e3cc814f0384](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b4d4b4cb019bd7240a52daa4ba61e3cc814f0384).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Hui Peng from Baidu Security.", "methods": ["Out-of-bounds write in `scatter_nd` function."]}
