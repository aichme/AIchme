{"description": "### Impact\nAffected versions of the link plugin and link UI component do not sanitize URLs to prevent use of the `javascript:` scheme. As a result, links with JavaScript URLs can be inserted into the Plate editor through various means, including opening or pasting malicious content.\n\n### Patches\n`@udecode/plate-link` 20.0.0 resolves this issue by introducing an `allowedSchemes` option to the link plugin, defaulting to `['http', 'https', 'mailto', 'tel']`. URLs using a scheme that isn't in this list will not be rendered to the DOM.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you are unable to update `@udecode/plate-link` to version 20.0.0, we recommend overriding the `LinkElement` and `PlateFloatingLink` components with implementations that explicitly check the URL scheme before rendering any anchor elements.\n", "methods": ["Allows use of the `javascript:` scheme in URLs.", "Allows insertion of malicious content through various means.", "Allows insertion of malicious content through opening or pasting.", "Allows insertion of malicious content through various means, including pasting.", "Allows insertion of malicious content through opening."]}
