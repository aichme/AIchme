{"description": "BerriAI/litellm version v1.35.8 contains a vulnerability where an attacker can achieve remote code execution. The vulnerability exists in the `add_deployment` function, which decodes and decrypts environment variables from base64 and assigns them to `os.environ`. An attacker can exploit this by sending a malicious payload to the `/config/update` endpoint, which is then processed and executed by the server when the `get_secret` function is triggered. This requires the server to use Google KMS and a database to store a model.", "methods": ["Used eval to execute malicious code.", "Used environment variables to inject malicious code.", "Used a web application to process and execute malicious payloads.", "Used a database to store sensitive information.", "Used a third-party service (Google KMS) to store sensitive information.", "Used a web application endpoint to execute malicious code (/config/update)."]}
