{"description": "It is possible to, given a global CSRF token such as the one present in the authenticity_token meta tag, forge a per-form CSRF token for any action for that session.\n\nImpact\n------\n\nGiven the ability to extract the global CSRF token, an attacker would be able to construct a per-form CSRF token for that session.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\n\nThis is a low-severity security issue. As such, no workaround is necessarily until such time as the application can be upgraded.", "methods": ["Forged a per-form CSRF token for any action for that session.", "Extracted a global CSRF token from the authenticity_token meta tag."]}
