{"description": "Job and Node ownership Plugin 0.13.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in several HTTP endpoints. This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to change the owners and item-specific permissions of a job. Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n", "methods": ["Used a CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins Job and Node ownership Plugin.", "Exploited a lack of permission checks in HTTP endpoints.", "Manipulated job ownership and permissions without authentication."]}
