{"description": "If an attacker launches many login attempts in parallel then the attacker can have more guesses at a password than the brute force protection configuration permits. This is due to the brute force check occurring before the brute force protector has locked the user.\n\n**Acknowledgements:**\nSpecial thanks to Maurizio Agazzini for reporting this issue and helping us improve our project.", "methods": ["Attempted brute force login with parallel requests.", "Exploited a timing vulnerability in brute force protection."]}
