{"description": "### Impact\nDue to issues in Go's standard library XML parsing, a valid SAML response may be mutated by an attacker to modify the trusted document. This can result in allowing unverified logins from a SAML IdP.\n\nUsers that configure Fleet with SSO login may be vulnerable to this issue.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is patched in 3.5.1 using https://github.com/mattermost/xml-roundtrip-validator.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrade to 3.5.1 is not possible, users should disable SSO authentication in Fleet.\n\n### References\nSee https://mattermost.com/blog/coordinated-disclosure-go-xml-vulnerabilities/ for more information about the underlying vulnerabilities.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@fleetdm.com](mailto:security@fleetdm.com)\n* Join #fleet in [osquery Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw)", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in the Go standard library XML parsing.", "Modified a trusted document to allow unverified logins from a SAML IdP.", "Used a SAML authentication vulnerability to gain unauthorized access.", "Disrupted the trusted document validation process.", "Used a vulnerability in the Fleet SSO login configuration."]}
