{"description": "We've discovered a vulnerability in which attackers could forge HTTP requests to manipulate the `charm` data directory to access or delete anything on the server. This has been patched in https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/commit/3c90668f955c7ce5ef721e4fc9faee7053232fd3 and is available in release [v0.12.1](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/releases/tag/v0.12.1). We recommend that all users running self-hosted `charm` instances update immediately.\n\nThis vulnerability was found in-house and we haven't been notified of any potential exploiters.\n\n### Additional notes\n\n* Encrypted user data uploaded to the Charm server is safe as Charm servers cannot decrypt user data. This includes filenames, paths, and all key-value data.\n* Users running the official Charm [Docker images](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/blob/main/docker.md) are at minimal risk because the exploit is limited to the containerized filesystem.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a [discussion](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm/discussions)\n* Email us at [vt100@charm.sh](mailto:vt100@charm.sh)\n* Chat with us on [Slack](https://charm.sh/slack)\n\n* * *\n\n<a href=\"https://charm.sh/\"><img alt=\"the Charm logo\" src=\"https://stuff.charm.sh/charm-badge.jpg\" width=\"400\"></a>\n\nCharm\u70ed\u7231\u5f00\u6e90 \u2022 Charm loves open source", "methods": ["Used Server-Side Request Forgery to manipulate the `charm` data directory.", "Used the vulnerability to access or delete anything on the server."]}
