This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.", "methods": ["Stored credentials in plain text in a configuration file.", "Transmitted credentials in plain text through a web interface.", "Exposed credentials through browser extensions and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities."]}
