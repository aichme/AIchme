What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nPatched in notebook 6.1.5\n\n\n### References\n\n[OWASP page on open redirects](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or vulnerabilities to report, please email our security list [security@ipython.org](mailto:security@ipython.org).\n\nCredit: zhuonan li of Alibaba Application Security Team", "methods": ["Used a maliciously crafted link to redirect the browser to a different website.", "Exploited an open redirect vulnerability in Jupyter Notebook."]}
