{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation for `tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord` and `tf.raw_ops.DatasetToTFRecord` can trigger heap buffer overflow and segmentation fault:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ndataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(3)\ndataset = tf.data.experimental.to_variant(dataset)\ntf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord(\n  input_dataset=dataset,\n  filename='/tmp/output',\n  compression_type='')\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f24faa153ad31a4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/data/experimental/to_tf_record_op.cc#L93-L102) assumes that all records in the dataset are of string type. However, there is no check for that, and the example given above uses numeric types.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap buffer overflow", "Segmentation fault", "Lack of input validation", "Use of unpatched version of TensorFlow", "Use of vulnerable code in `tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord` and `tf.raw_ops.DatasetToTFRecord`"]}
