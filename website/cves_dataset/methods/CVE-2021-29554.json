{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error in `tf.raw_ops.DenseCountSparseOutput`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nvalues = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0], dtype=tf.int64)\nweights = tf.constant([])\n\ntf.raw_ops.DenseCountSparseOutput(\n  values=values, weights=weights,\n  minlength=-1, maxlength=58, binary_output=True)\n```\n  \nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/efff014f3b2d8ef6141da30c806faf141297eca1/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L123-L127) computes a divisor value from user data but does not check that the result is 0 before doing the division:\n\n```cc\nint num_batch_elements = 1;\nfor (int i = 0; i < num_batch_dimensions; ++i) {\n  num_batch_elements *= data.shape().dim_size(i);\n}\nint num_value_elements = data.shape().num_elements() / num_batch_elements;\n```\n\nSince `data` is given by the `values` argument, `num_batch_elements` is 0.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [da5ff2daf618591f64b2b62d9d9803951b945e9f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/da5ff2daf618591f64b2b62d9d9803951b945e9f).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are also affected.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Division by 0 in `DenseCountSparseOutput` to cause a denial of service via a FPE runtime error."]}
