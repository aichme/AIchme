{"description": "Multiple path traversal vulnerabilities exist in smbserver.py in Impacket before 0.9.23. An attacker that connects to a running smbserver instance can list and write to arbitrary files via ../ directory traversal. This could potentially be abused to achieve arbitrary code execution by replacing /etc/shadow or an SSH authorized key.", "methods": ["Used path traversal to list and write to arbitrary files.", "Used path traversal to replace /etc/shadow or an SSH authorized key."]}
