{"description": "Affected versions of this crate called mem::uninitialized() to create values of a user-supplied type T. This is unsound e.g. if T is a reference type (which must be non-null and thus may not remain uninitialized). The flaw was corrected by avoiding the use of mem::uninitialized(), using MaybeUninit instead.", "methods": ["Used uninitialized memory to create values of a user-supplied type.", "Used unsound code to create non-null references.", "Avoided using mem::uninitialized() and instead used MaybeUninit."]}
