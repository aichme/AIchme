{"description": "JPA Server in HAPI FHIR before 5.4.0 allows a user to deny service (e.g., disable access to the database after the attack stops) via history requests. This occurs because of a SELECT COUNT statement that requires a full index scan, with an accompanying large amount of server resources if there are many simultaneous history requests.", "methods": ["Deny Service: A user can cause a denial of service by sending multiple history requests, consuming server resources.", "Resource Consumption: The attacker can cause the server to consume a large amount of resources, leading to a denial of service."]}
