{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow:\n  \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\norig_input_tensor_shape = tf.constant([1, 3, 2, 3], shape=[4], dtype=tf.int64)\nout_backprop = tf.constant([2], shape=[1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int64)\nrow_pooling_sequence = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)\ncol_pooling_sequence = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)\n\n\ntf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(\n  orig_input_tensor_shape=orig_input_tensor_shape, out_backprop=out_backprop,\n  row_pooling_sequence=row_pooling_sequence,\n  col_pooling_sequence=col_pooling_sequence, overlapping=False)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/dcba796a28364d6d7f003f6fe733d82726dda713/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L216) fails to validate that the pooling sequence arguments have enough elements as required by the `out_backprop` tensor shape.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [12c727cee857fa19be717f336943d95fca4ffe4f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/12c727cee857fa19be717f336943d95fca4ffe4f).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Used a heap buffer overflow in `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` to cause a vulnerability.", "Failed to validate that the pooling sequence arguments have enough elements as required by the `out_backprop` tensor shape."]}
