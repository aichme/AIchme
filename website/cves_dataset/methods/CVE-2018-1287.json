{"description": "In Apache JMeter 2.X and 3.X, when using Distributed Test only (RMI based), jmeter server binds RMI Registry to wildcard host. This could allow an attacker to get Access to JMeterEngine and send unauthorized code. This only affect those running in Distributed mode.\n\nIn distributed mode, JMeter makes an architectural assumption that it is operating on a 'safe' network. i.e. everyone with access to the network is considered trusted.", "methods": ["Uses RMI Registry to send unauthorized code.", "Exploits architectural assumption of a 'safe' network."]}
