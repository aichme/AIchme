{"description": "### Impact\n\nCSRF vulnerability that allows user account takeover.\n\nAll applications using any version of the frontend component of `spree_auth_devise` are affected if `protect_from_forgery` method is both:\n\n* Executed whether as:\n  * A before_action callback (the default)\n  * A prepend_before_action (option prepend: true given) before the :load_object hook in Spree::UserController (most likely order to find).\n* Configured to use :null_session or :reset_session strategies (:null_session is the default in case the no strategy is given, but rails --new generated skeleton use :exception).\n\nThat means that applications that haven't been configured differently from what it's generated with Rails aren't affected.\n\nThanks @waiting-for-dev for reporting and providing a patch ? \n\n### Patches\n\nSpree 4.3 users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.4.1\nSpree 4.2 users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.2.1\nSpree 4.1 users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.1.1\nOlder Spree version users should update to spree_auth_devise 4.0.1\n \n### Workarounds\n\nIf possible, change your strategy to :exception:\n\n```ruby\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n  protect_from_forgery with: :exception\nend\n```\n\nAdd the following to`config/application.rb `to at least run the `:exception` strategy on the affected controller:\n\n```ruby\nconfig.after_initialize do\n  Spree::UsersController.protect_from_forgery with: :exception\nend\n```\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/solidusio/solidus_auth_devise/security/advisories/GHSA-xm34-v85h-9pg2\n", "methods": ["Uses a CSRF weakness to bypass authentication.", "Uses a vulnerability in `spree_auth_devise` to take over user accounts.", "Uses a `before_action` callback to execute the `protect_from_forgery` method.", "Uses a `prepend_before_action` to execute the `protect_from_forgery` method.", "Uses a `null_session` or `reset_session` strategy to bypass authentication.", "Uses a `:exception` strategy to prevent authentication bypass."]}
