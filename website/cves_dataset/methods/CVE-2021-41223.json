{"description": "### Impact\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e71b86d47f8bc1816bf54d7bddc4170e47670b97/tensorflow/core/kernels/fused_batch_norm_op.cc#L1292) of `FusedBatchNorm` kernels is vulnerable to a heap OOB:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n    \ntf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNormGrad(\n  y_backprop=tf.constant([i for i in range(9)],shape=(1,1,3,3),dtype=tf.float32)\n  x=tf.constant([i for i in range(2)],shape=(1,1,1,2),dtype=tf.float32)\n  scale=[1,1],\n  reserve_space_1=[1,1],\n  reserve_space_2=[1,1,1],\n  epsilon=1.0,\n  data_format='NCHW',\n  is_training=True) \n```\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [aab9998916c2ffbd8f0592059fad352622f89cda](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/aab9998916c2ffbd8f0592059fad352622f89cda).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB in `FusedBatchNorm` kernels.", "Implemented in TensorFlow.", "Patched in GitHub commit aab9998916c2ffbd8f0592059fad352622f89cda.", "Fixed in TensorFlow 2.7.0.", "Cherrypicked in TensorFlow 2.6.1, 2.5.2, and 2.4.4.", "Reported by Aivul Team from Qihoo 360."]}
