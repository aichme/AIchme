{"description": "### Impact\n\n`SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` is not expected to revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-1271 as expected.\n\nThe contracts that may be affected are those that use `SignatureChecker` to check the validity of a signature and handle invalid signatures in a way other than reverting. We believe this to be unlikely.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue was patched in 4.7.1.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/3552\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or need assistance deploying the fix, email us at [security@openzeppelin.com](mailto:security@openzeppelin.com).", "methods": ["Incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's abi.decode allows some cases to revert.", "Incorrect handling of invalid signatures in a way other than reverting."]}
