Delete the package\n2. Clear your npm cache\n3. Ensure it is not present in any other package.json files on your system\n4. Regenerate your SSH keys, registry credentials, tokens, and any other sensitive credentials that may have been present in your bash history.\n\nAdditionally, any service which may have been exposed via credentials in your bash history or accessible via your ssh keys, such as a database, should be reviewed for indicators of compromise as well.", "methods": ["Used a package manager (npm) to install malware.", "Used a package manager (npm) to exfiltrate sensitive data.", "Used a package manager (npm) to send data to attacker-controlled locations.", "Used a package manager (npm) to discover sensitive data (SSH key and bash history).", "Used a package manager (npm) to setup persistence (unpublished from the npm registry).", "Used a package manager (npm) to execute malicious actions (delete, clear cache, regenerate credentials).", "Used a package manager (npm) to access sensitive data (registry credentials, tokens).", "Used a package manager (npm) to access a service (database) via credentials."]}
