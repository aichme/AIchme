{"description": "Description\n-----------\n\nOn Symfony before 4.4.0, when a `Firewall` checks an access control rule (using the unanimous strategy), it iterates over all rule attributes and grant access only if *all* calls to the `accessDecisionManager` decide to grant access.\n\nAs of Symfony 4.4.0, a bug was introduced that prevents the check of attributes as soon as `accessDecisionManager` decide to grant access on one attribute.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nThe `accessDecisionManager` is now called with all attributes at once, allowing the unanimous strategy being applied on each attribute. \n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/c935e4a3fba6cc2ab463a6ca382858068d63cebf) for the 4.4 branch.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nI would like to thank Antonio J. Garc\u00eda Lagar for reporting & Robin Chalas for fixing the issue.", "methods": ["Used a bug in Symfony Firewall unanimous strategy to bypass access control checks.", "Exploited a bug in Symfony 4.4.0 to grant access without checking all rule attributes."]}
