{"description": "### Impact\nSeveral `HandleRoute` endpoints make use of the deprecated `ioutil.ReadAll()`. `ioutil.ReadAll()` reads all the data into memory. As such, an attacker who sends a large request to the Argo Events server will be able to crash it and cause denial of service.\n\nEventsources susceptible to an out-of-memory denial-of-service attack:\n\n- AWS SNS\n- Bitbucket\n- Bitbucket\n- Gitlab\n- Slack\n- Storagegrid\n- Webhook\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo Events version:\n\nv1.7.1\n\n### Credits\nDisclosed by [Ada Logics](https://adalogics.com/) in a security audit sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF.\n\n### For more information\nOpen an issue in the [Argo Events issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/discussions)\nJoin us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-events", "methods": ["Uses of deprecated API can cause DoS in user-facing endpoints.", "Sending large requests to the Argo Events server can cause denial of service.", "An attacker can crash the Argo Events server and cause denial of service by sending a large request.", "An out-of-memory denial-of-service attack can be launched against Eventsources such as AWS SNS, Bitbucket, Gitlab, Slack, Storagegrid, and Webhook."]}
