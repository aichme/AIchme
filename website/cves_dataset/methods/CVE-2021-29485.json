{"description": "### Impact\n\nA malicious attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) via a maliciously crafted Java deserialization gadget chain leveraged against the Ratpack session store.\n\nIf your application does not use Ratpack's session mechanism, it is not vulnerable.\n\n### Details\n\nAttackers with the ability to write to session data, can potentially craft payloads that deserialize unsafe objects, leading to the ability to remotely execute arbitrary code. \nThis is known as an \u201c[insecure deserialization](https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization)\u201d vulnerability, or \u201cgadget vulnerability\u201d.\n\nRatpack allows session data to be stored server side in an external system such as a relational database, or client side via user cookies.\nWhen using server side storage, the attacker would need to obtain the ability to write to the session data store.\nWhen using client side storage, the attacker would need to obtain the secrets used to encrypt and/or sign the session data stored in user cookies.\n\nRatpack's session mechanism allows storing serialized objects, of arbitrary types. \nThe type must be specified when writing the data and when reading, with data only deserialized when there is an exact type match.\nHowever, in the process of deserializing an object of a known/trusted/deserialization-safe type, it may attempt to deserialize unsafe types.\n\nBy default Ratpack uses Java's built-in serialization mechanism, though other serialization providers can be used.\nThe exact types of payloads required to enable an exploit depend on the exact serialization mechanism used.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, Ratpack now employs a \u201cstrict allow-list\u201d when deserializing (and serializing) objects to session data. \nAll concrete types of objects serialized must be explicitly declared as safe.\nSome standard well known JDK types are registered by default.\n\nSerialization is provided by implementations of [`SessionSerializer`](https://ratpack.io/manual/1.9.0/api/ratpack/session/SessionSerializer.html).\nIts existing methods have been deprecated, and replaced with a [new methods](https://ratpack.io/manual/1.9.0/api/ratpack/session/SessionSerializer.html#deserialize(java.lang.Class,java.io.InputStream,ratpack.session.SessionTypeFilter)) that accept a [`SessionTypeFilter`](https://ratpack.io/manual/1.9.0/api/ratpack/session/SessionTypeFilter.html) that can be used to assert whether a type is allowed when serializing and deserializing.\n\nThe default serializer implementation has been updated to use this mechanism.\nAny proprietary implementations should also be updated to consult the type filter _before_ serializing or deserializing data.\nWarnings will be logged any time an implementation that does not implement the new methods is used.\n\nUpon upgrading to Ratpack 1.9, users of the built-in serialization mechanism will need to change their application to declare all types currently being serialized as being safe. This can be done using the new [`SessionModule.allowTypes()`](https://ratpack.io/manual/1.9.0/api/ratpack/session/SessionModule.html#allowTypes(com.google.inject.Binder,java.lang.Class...)) method. Please see its documentation for details...))\n\n### Patches\n\nRatpack 1.9.0 introduces a strict allow-list mechanism that mitigates this vulnerability when used.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe simplest mitigation for users of earlier versions is to reduce the likelihood of attackers being able to write to the session data store. \n\nAlternatively or additionally, the allow-list mechanism could be manually back ported by providing an alternative implementation of `SessionSerializer` that uses an allow-list.\n\n### References\n\n - https://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/\n - https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data\n", "methods": ["Used Java deserialization gadget chain to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).", "Exploited insecure deserialization vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.", "Used a \"gadget vulnerability\" to bypass type checks and execute malicious code.", "Attempted to deserialize unsafe objects to execute malicious code.", "Used a \"strict allow-list\" to deserialize objects to session data.", "Employed a SessionTypeFilter to assert whether a type is allowed when serializing and deserializing.", "Used a proprietary implementation of SessionSerializer to serialize and deserialize data.", "Used a default serializer implementation that has been updated to use the new SessionTypeFilter mechanism.", "Used the SessionModule.allowTypes() method to declare all types currently being serialized as safe.", "Used a relational database or client-side storage to store session data.", "Used user cookies to store session data.", "Used Java's built-in serialization mechanism to serialize and deserialize objects.", "Used a SessionSerializer to deserialize objects from an InputStream.", "Used a SessionTypeFilter to filter types when serializing and deserializing objects."]}
