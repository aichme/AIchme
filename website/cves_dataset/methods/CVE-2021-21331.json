{"description": "### Impact\nLocal information disclosure of sensitive information downloaded via the API using the API Client. \n\n### Finding\nThe Datadog API is executed on a unix-like system with multiple users. The API is used to download a file containing sensitive information. This sensitive information is exposed locally to other users. This vulnerability exists in the API Client for version 1 and 2. The method `prepareDownloadFilecreates` creates a temporary file with the permissions bits of `-rw-r--r--` on unix-like systems. On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between users. As such, the contents of the file downloaded via the `downloadFileFromResponse` method will be visible to all other users on the local system.\n\nAnalysis of the finding determined that the affected code was unused, meaning that the exploitation likelihood is low. The unused code has been removed, effectively mitigating this issue. \n\nThis vulnerability was found due to [this query](https://lgtm.com/query/8938575359870595124/) that [Jonathan Leitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) contributed to the Semmle QL project.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in [version 1.0.0-beta.9](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-client-java/releases/tag/datadog-api-client-1.0.0-beta.9). \n\nSee also [Remove unused downloadFile helpers](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-client-java/pull/637). \n\n### Workarounds\nThe recommended workaround is to specify `java.io.tmpdir` when starting the JVM with the flag `-Djava.io.tmpdir`, specifying a path to a directory with `drw-------` permissions owned by `dd-agent`.\n\n### References\n* [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\n* [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [DataDog/datadog-api-client-java](https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-client-java)\t\n* Email us at [security@datadoghq.com](mailto:security@datadoghq.com)", "methods": ["Used CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions.", "Used CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions.", "Used API Client to download sensitive information.", "Used API Client to create temporary files with permissions bits of -rw-r--r--.", "Used API Client to download files with permissions visible to all users on the local system.", "Used unused code to potentially disclose sensitive information.", "Used unused code to create temporary files with insecure permissions.", "Used unused code to download files with insecure permissions."]}
