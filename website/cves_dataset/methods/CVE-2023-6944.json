{"description": "A flaw was found in the Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH). The catalog-import function leaks GitLab access tokens on the frontend when the base64 encoded GitLab token includes a newline at the end of the string. The sanitized error can display on the frontend, including the raw access token. Upon gaining access to this token and depending on permissions, an attacker could push malicious code to repositories, delete resources in Git, revoke or generate new keys, and sign code illegitimately.", "methods": ["Leaks sensitive information (GitLab access tokens) on the frontend.", "Uses a flaw in the catalog-import function to obtain sensitive information.", "Uses base64 encoding to hide sensitive information.", "Uses a newline character to manipulate the encoded string.", "Uses the frontend to display sensitive information.", "Uses permissions to push malicious code to repositories.", "Uses permissions to delete resources in Git.", "Uses permissions to revoke or generate new keys.", "Uses permissions to sign code illegitimately."]}
