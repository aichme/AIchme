{"description": "### Impact\n\n`Mail.MailConfig` can be edited by any logged-in user by default. Consequently, they can:\n- change the mail obfuscation configuration\n- view and edit the mail sending configuration, including the smtp domain name and credentials.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched on XWiki 14.4.8, 15.1, and 14.10.6.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe rights of the `Mail.MailConfig` page can be manually updated so that only a set of trusted users can view, edit and delete it (e.g., the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group).\nOn 14.4.8+, 15.1-rc-1+, or 14.10.5+, if at startup `Mail.MailConfig` does not have any rights defined, `view`, `edit ` and `delete` rights are automatically granted to the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group.\nSee the corresponding [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d28d7739089e1ae8961257d9da7135d1a01cb7d4).\n\n### References\n- https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20519 + https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20671\n- https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/d28d7739089e1ae8961257d9da7135d1a01cb7d4\n- https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/8910b8857d3442d2e8142f655fdc0512930354d1\n\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n*    Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n*    Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Can be edited by any user with edit rights.", "Can change mail obfuscation configuration.", "Can view and edit mail sending configuration, including smtp domain name and credentials.", "Can be manually updated to restrict access to trusted users.", "Automatically grants view, edit, and delete rights to XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup if no rights are defined."]}
