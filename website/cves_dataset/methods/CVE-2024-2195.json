{"description": "A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability was identified in the aimhubio/aim project, specifically within the `/api/runs/search/run/` endpoint, affecting versions >= 3.0.0. The vulnerability resides in the `run_search_api` function of the `aim/web/api/runs/views.py` file, where improper restriction of user access to the `RunView` object allows for the execution of arbitrary code via the `query` parameter. This issue enables attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable API endpoint to execute arbitrary code.", "Executed arbitrary commands on the server.", "Executed arbitrary code via a user-controlled parameter (query).", "Enabled full system compromise."]}
