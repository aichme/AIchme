{"description": "A flaw was found in the fabric8-maven-plugin 4.0.0 and later. When using a wildfly-swarm or thorntail custom configuration, a malicious YAML configuration file on the local machine executing the maven plug-in could allow for deserialization of untrusted data resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n\nThe fabric8-maven-plugin has been superseded by the Eclipse project JKube and the recommendation is migrating users of the fabric8-maven-plugin to Eclipse Jkube >= 1.0.0", "methods": ["Deserialization of untrusted data to execute arbitrary code.", "Remote code execution via a malicious YAML configuration file."]}
