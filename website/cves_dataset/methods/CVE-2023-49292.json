{"description": "### Impact\nIf functions `Encapsulate()`, `Decapsulate()` and `ECDH()` could be called by an attacker, he could recover any private key that he interacts with.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in v2.0.8\n\n### Workarounds\nYou could manually check public key by calling `IsOnCurve()` function from secp256k1 libraries.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/ashutosh1206/Crypton/blob/master/Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange/Attack-Invalid-Curve-Point/README.md\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the github.com/ecies library to recover private keys.", "Exploited functions `Encapsulate()`, `Decapsulate()`, and `ECDH()` to interact with private keys.", "Used an invalid curve point attack to recover private keys."]}
