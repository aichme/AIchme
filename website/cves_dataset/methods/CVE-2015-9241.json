{"description": "Versions of `hapi` prior to 11.1.3 are affected by a denial of service vulnerability.\n\nThe vulnerability is triggered when certain input is passed into the If-Modified-Since or Last-Modified headers.\n\nThis causes an 'illegal access' exception to be raised, and instead of sending a HTTP 500 error back to the sender, hapi will continue to hold the socket open until timed out (default node timeout is 2 minutes).\n\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to v11.1.3 or later", "methods": ["None", "None", "None", "None"]}
