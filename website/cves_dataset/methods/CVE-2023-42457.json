Series 1.x is not affected.\n\n### Workarounds\nIn your frontend web server (nginx, Apache) you can redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++`.", "methods": ["Used a Denial of Service (DoS) technique by repeatedly using the `++api++` traverser in a URL.", "Used a web server to handle HTTP requests (nginx, Apache).", "Implemented a workaround to redirect a URL to prevent DoS."]}
