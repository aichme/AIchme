When combined with a java.io.InputStreamReader this can lead to an infinite stream, which can be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use Compress' zip package.", "methods": ["Used a specially crafted ZIP archive to cause a denial of service attack.", "Exploited a vulnerability in org.apache.commons:commons-compress to create an infinite stream.", "Used a java.io.InputStreamReader to mount a denial of service attack."]}
