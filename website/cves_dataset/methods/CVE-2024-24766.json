{"description": "### Summary\n\nThe Casa OS Login page has disclosed the username enumeration vulnerability in the login page.\n\n### Details\n\nIt is observed that the attacker can enumerate the CasaOS username using the application response. If the username is incorrect application gives the error \"**User does not exist**\",  If the password is incorrect application gives the error \"**Invalid password**\". \n\n### PoC\n\nCapture the login request in a tool like Burp Suit and use the intruder tab for trying multiple usernames. \nKeep checking the response of each request if the response says **Invalid password** then the username is right.\n\n### Impact\n\nUsing this error attacker can enumerate the username of CasaOS. \n\n### The logic behind the issue\n\nIf the username is incorrect, then throw an error \"User does not exist\" else throw an error \"Invalid password\".\n\nThis condition can be vice versa like:\n\nIf the password is incorrect, then throw an error \"Invalid password\" else throw an error \"User does not exist\".\n\n### Mitigation\n\nSince this is the condition we have to implement a single error which can be \"Username/Password is Incorrect!!!\"\n\n\n\n", "methods": ["Used username enumeration to gather information about valid usernames.", "Used error messages to infer the validity of usernames and passwords.", "Used a login page to interact with the application.", "Used a tool like Burp Suite to capture and manipulate login requests.", "Used the intruder tab in Burp Suite to automate username enumeration."]}
