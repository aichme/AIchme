{"description": "### Summary\n\nhyper's HTTP server and client code had a flaw that could trigger an integer overflow when decoding chunk sizes that are too big. This allows possible data loss, or if combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that allows chunk sizes larger than hyper does, can result in \"request smuggling\" or \"desync attacks\".\n\n### Vulnerability\n\nExample:\n\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\n\nf0000000000000003\nabc\n0\n\n```\n\nhyper only reads the rightmost 64-bit integer as the chunk size. So it reads `f0000000000000003` as `3`. A loss of data can occur since hyper would then read only 3 bytes of the body. Additionally, an HTTP request smuggling vulnerability would occur if using a proxy which instead has prefix truncation in the chunk size, or that understands larger than 64-bit chunk sizes.\n\nRead more about desync attacks: https://portswigger.net/research/http-desync-attacks-request-smuggling-reborn\n\n### Impact\n\nTo determine if vulnerable to _data loss_, these things must be true:\n\n- **Using HTTP/1.1.** Since HTTP/2 does not use chunked encoding, it is not vulnerable.\n- **Using hyper as a server or client.** The body would be improperly truncated in either case.\n- **Users send requests or responses with chunk sizes greater than 18 exabytes**.\n\nTo determine if vulnerable to _desync attacks_, these things must be true:\n\n- **Using an upstream proxy that allows chunks sizes larger than 64-bit.** If the proxy rejects chunk sizes that are too large, that request won't be forwarded to hyper.\n\n### Patches\n\nWe have released the following patch versions:\n\n - v0.14.10 (to be released when this advisory is published)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nBesides upgrading hyper, you can take the following options:\n\n- Reject requests manually that contain a `Transfer-Encoding` header.\n- Ensure any upstream proxy rejects `Transfer-Encoding` chunk sizes greater than what fits in 64-bit unsigned integers.\n\n\n### Credits\nThis issue was initially reported by [Mattias Grenfeldt](https://grenfeldt.dev/) and Asta Olofsson.", "methods": ["Used HTTP/1.1 protocol.", "Used chunked transfer encoding.", "Used HTTP proxy that allows chunk sizes larger than 64-bit.", "Used prefix truncation in chunk size.", "Used upstream proxy that rejects chunk sizes that are too large.", "Used hyper as a server or client.", "Sent requests or responses with chunk sizes greater than 18 exabytes."]}
