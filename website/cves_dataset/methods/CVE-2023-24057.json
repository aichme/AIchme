{"description": "### Impact\n\nMITM can enable Zip-Slip.\n\n### Vulnerability\n\n#### Vulnerability 1: `Scanner.java`\n\nThere is no validation that the zip file being unpacked has entries that are not maliciously writing outside of the intended destination directory.\nhttps://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/8c43e21094af971303131efd081503e5a112db4b/org.hl7.fhir.validation/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/validation/Scanner.java#L335-L357\n\nThis zip archive is downloaded over HTTP instead of HTTPS, leaving it vulnerable to compromise in-flight.\nhttps://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/8c43e21094af971303131efd081503e5a112db4b/org.hl7.fhir.validation/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/validation/Scanner.java#L136\n\n##### Vulnerability 2: `TerminologyCacheManager.java`\n\n**Note:** While these links point to only one implementation, both implementations of `TerminologyCacheManager.java` are vulnerable to this as their code seems to be duplicated.\n - https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/f58b7acfb5e393cac52cc5bbb170bdb669c2880e/org.hl7.fhir.r5/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/r5/terminologies/TerminologyCacheManager.java\n - https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/f58b7acfb5e393cac52cc5bbb170bdb669c2880e/org.hl7.fhir.r4b/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/r4b/terminologies/TerminologyCacheManager.java\n\nWhile there is validation in this bit of logic that attempts to validate that the zip file doesn't contain malicious entries that escape the destination directory, the guard is insufficient.\n\nhttps://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/f58b7acfb5e393cac52cc5bbb170bdb669c2880e/org.hl7.fhir.r5/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/r5/terminologies/TerminologyCacheManager.java#L97-L113\n\nThis is because the `Utilities.path(String... path)` method does not normalize the path, although it seems to be attempting to do so.\nhttps://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/f58b7acfb5e393cac52cc5bbb170bdb669c2880e/org.hl7.fhir.utilities/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/utilities/Utilities.java#L617-L675\n\nThe normalization only occurs if the path element starts with a path traversal payload. As an example, calling `Utilities.path(\"/base\", \"/child/../test\")` will return the string `\"/base/child/../test\"`.\n\nThis guard logic can, thus, be easily bypassed:\nhttps://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/f58b7acfb5e393cac52cc5bbb170bdb669c2880e/org.hl7.fhir.r5/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/r5/terminologies/TerminologyCacheManager.java#L100-L104\n\nAssuming an attacker can control the return value of `ze.getName()`, they can supply a value like `/anything/../../../../zipsip-protection-bypass.txt`.\n\nSimilarly, an attacker can control the contents of the Zip file via a MITM attack as this logic is used with resources not downloaded over HTTPS.\n\nhttps://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/blob/f58b7acfb5e393cac52cc5bbb170bdb669c2880e/org.hl7.fhir.r5/src/main/java/org/hl7/fhir/r5/terminologies/TerminologyCacheManager.java#L66-L73\n\n\n### Patches\nUnknown\n\n### Workarounds\nUnknown\n\n### References\n\n - https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability", "methods": ["Used MITM to enable Zip-Slip.", "Used MITM to bypass path traversal protection in `Utilities.path(String... path)` method.", "Used MITM to control the contents of the Zip file.", "Downloaded zip archive over HTTP instead of HTTPS, leaving it vulnerable to compromise in-flight."]}
