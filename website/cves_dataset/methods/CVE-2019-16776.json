{"description": "Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to a symlink reference outside of node_modules. It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside of the`node_modules` folder through the `bin` field upon installation. A properly constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package publisher to create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files on a user\u2019s system when the package is installed. Only files accessible by the user running the `npm install` are affected.  \n\nThis behavior is still possible through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the --ignore-scripts install option.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 6.13.3 or later.", "methods": ["Created a symlink to a file outside of the node_modules folder.", "Used the package.json bin field to create a malicious symlink.", "Bypassed the --ignore-scripts install option to execute install scripts.", "Executed arbitrary code through install scripts."]}
