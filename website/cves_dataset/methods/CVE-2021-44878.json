{"description": "If an OpenID Connect provider supports the \u201cnone\u201d algorithm (i.e., tokens with no signature), pac4j v5.3.0 (and prior) does not refuse it without an explicit configuration on its side or for the \u201cidtoken\u201d response type which is not secure and violates the OpenID Core Specification. The \"none\" algorithm does not require any signature verification when validating the ID tokens, which allows the attacker to bypass the token validation by injecting a malformed ID token using \"none\" as the value of \"alg\" key in the header with an empty signature value.", "methods": ["Bypasses signature verification in OpenID Connect token validation.", "Injects a malformed ID token with an empty signature value.", "Uses the \"none\" algorithm in the token header."]}
