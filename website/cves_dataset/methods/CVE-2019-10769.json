{"description": "All versions of `safer-eval` are vulnerable to Sandbox Escape leading to Remote Code Execution. The package fails to restrict access to the main context and is not suited to process arbitrary user input. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe package is not meant to receive user input. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary code execution to execute malicious code in the system.", "Failed to restrict access to the main context.", "Processed arbitrary user input."]}
