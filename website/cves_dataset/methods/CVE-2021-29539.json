{"description": "### Impact\nCalling [`tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/ImmutableConst) with a `dtype` of `tf.resource` or `tf.variant` results in a segfault in the implementation as code assumes that the tensor contents are pure scalars.\n\n```python\n>>> import tensorflow as tf\n>>> tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst(dtype=tf.resource, shape=[], memory_region_name=\"/tmp/test.txt\")\n...\nSegmentation fault\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in 4f663d4b8f0bec1b48da6fa091a7d29609980fa4 and will release TensorFlow 2.5.0 containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this commit will also have the issue resolved.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf using `tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst` in code, you can prevent the segfault by inserting a filter for the `dtype` argument.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["None", "None", "None", "None"]}
