{"description": "### Impact\nThe logic in place to facilitate the update process via the user interface lacks access control to verify if permission exists to perform the tasks. Prior to this patch being applied it might be possible for an attacker to access the Mautic version number or to execute parts of the upgrade process without permission. As upgrading in the user interface is deprecated, this functionality is no longer required.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to 4.4.13 or 5.1.1 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@mautic.org](mailto:security@mautic.org)\n", "methods": ["Lacked access control to verify user permissions for UI upgrade process.", "Executed unauthorized tasks in the upgrade process.", "Accessed Mautic version number without permission.", "Executed parts of the upgrade process without permission."]}
