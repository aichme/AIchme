{"description": "### Impact\nThe processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information.  An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in a server-side forgery request. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nIf you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.16\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-21342](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-21342.html).\n\n### Credits\n\u949f\u6f66\u8d35 (Liaogui Zhong) found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)", "methods": ["Manipulated input streams to inject objects.", "Used XStream to access data streams from an arbitrary URL.", "Created server-side forgery requests.", "Used type information to recreate objects.", "Injected objects to create server-side forgery requests.", "Manipulated type information to create new instances."]}
