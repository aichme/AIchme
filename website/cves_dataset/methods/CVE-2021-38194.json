{"description": "An issue was discovered in the ark-r1cs-std crate before 0.3.1 for Rust. It does not enforce any constraints in the FieldVar::mul_by_inverse method. Thus, a prover can produce a proof that is unsound but is nonetheless verified.", "methods": ["Used a calculation error in the ark-r1cs-std crate to produce an unsound proof that is verified.", "Exploited a lack of constraint enforcement in the FieldVar::mul_by_inverse method."]}
