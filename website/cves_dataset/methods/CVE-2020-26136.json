{"description": "The GraphQL module accepts basic-auth as an authentication method by default. This can be used to bypass MFA authentication if the silverstripe/mfa module is installed, which is now a commonly installed module. A users password is still required though.\n\nBasic-auth has been removed as a default authentication method. If desired, it can be re-enabled by adding it to the authenticators key of a schema, or on SilverStripe\\Graphql\\Auth\\Handler", "methods": ["Bypassed MFA authentication using basic-auth as an authentication method.", "Removed default authentication method to re-enable basic-auth.", "Used authentication bypass to access system."]}
