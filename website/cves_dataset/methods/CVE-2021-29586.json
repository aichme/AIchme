{"description": "### Impact\nOptimized pooling implementations in TFLite fail to check that the stride arguments are not 0 before calling [`ComputePaddingHeightWidth`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3f24ccd932546416ec906a02ddd183b48a1d2c83/tensorflow/lite/kernels/pooling.cc#L90).\n\nSince users can craft special models which will have `params->stride_{height,width}` be zero, this will result in a division by zero.\n                          \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5f7975d09eac0f10ed8a17dbb6f5964977725adc).\n      \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n      \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Division by zero in optimized pooling implementations in TFLite.", "Craft special models to exploit division by zero."]}
