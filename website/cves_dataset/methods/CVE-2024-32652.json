{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe application hangs when receiving a Host header with a value that `@hono/node-server` can't handle well. Invalid values are those that cannot be parsed by the `URL` as a hostname such as an empty string, slashes `/`, and other strings.\n\nFor example, if you have a simple application:\n\n```ts\nimport { serve } from '@hono/node-server'\nimport { Hono } from 'hono'\n\nconst app = new Hono()\n\napp.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello'))\n\nserve(app)\n```\n\nSending a request with a Host header with an empty value to it:\n\n```\ncurl localhost:3000/ -H \"Host: \"\n```\n\nThe results:\n\n```\nnode:internal/url:775\n    this.#updateContext(bindingUrl.parse(input, base));\n                                   ^\n\nTypeError: Invalid URL\n    at new URL (node:internal/url:775:36)\n    at newRequest (/Users/yusuke/work/h/159/node_modules/@hono/node-server/dist/index.js:137:17)\n    at Server.<anonymous> (/Users/yusuke/work/h/159/node_modules/@hono/node-server/dist/index.js:399:17)\n    at Server.emit (node:events:514:28)\n    at Server.emit (node:domain:488:12)\n    at parserOnIncoming (node:_http_server:1143:12)\n    at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (node:_http_common:119:17) {\n  code: 'ERR_INVALID_URL',\n  input: 'http:///'\n}\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe version `1.10.1` includes the fix for this issue. But, you should use `1.11.0`, which has other fixes related to this issue. https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/160 https://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/161\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNothing. Upgrade your `@hono/node-server`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/honojs/node-server/issues/159\n", "methods": ["Denial of Service (DoS) via Host header with invalid value.", "Invalid URL parsing."]}
