If a Git reference is not passed along with the Git url, go-getter will then try to check the remote repository\u2019s HEAD reference of its default branch by passing arguments to the Git binary on the host it is executing on.\n\nAn attacker may format a Git URL in order to inject additional Git arguments to the Git call.\n\nConsumers of the go-getter library should evaluate the risk associated with these issues in the context of their go-getter usage and upgrade go-getter to 1.7.4 or later.", "methods": ["Injects arguments into a Git binary.", "Uses a Git URL to inject additional arguments to a Git call.", "Performs a Git operation with untrusted input."]}
