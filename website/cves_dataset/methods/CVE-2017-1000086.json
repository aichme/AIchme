Additionally, the plugin was not requiring requests to its API be sent via POST, thereby opening itself to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.", "methods": ["Allowed any user with Overall/Read access to change settings.", "Allowed any user with Overall/Read access to trigger backups.", "Allowed any user with Overall/Read access to restore backups.", "Allowed any user with Overall/Read access to download backups.", "Allowed any user with Overall/Read access to delete all previous backups via log rotation.", "Allowed Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks."]}
