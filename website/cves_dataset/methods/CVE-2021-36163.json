{"description": "In Apache Dubbo, users may choose to use the Hessian protocol. The Hessian protocol is implemented on top of HTTP and passes the body of a POST request directly to a HessianSkeleton: New HessianSkeleton are created without any configuration of the serialization factory and therefore without applying the dubbo properties for applying allowed or blocked type lists. In addition, the generic service is always exposed and therefore attackers do not need to figure out a valid service/method name pair. This is fixed in 2.7.13, 2.6.10.1", "methods": ["Used a Hessian protocol configuration vulnerability in Apache Dubbo.", "Exploited a lack of serialization factory configuration.", "Exposed a generic service without requiring a valid service/method name pair."]}
