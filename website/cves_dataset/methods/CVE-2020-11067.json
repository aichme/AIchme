{"description": "It has been discovered that backend user settings (in $BE_USER->uc) are vulnerable to insecure deserialization. In combination with vulnerabilities of 3rd party components this can lead to remote code execution. A valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.17 or 10.4.2 that fix the problem described.\n\n### References\n* https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-005", "methods": ["Insecure deserialization of backend user settings in TYPO3 CMS.", "Remote code execution via combination with 3rd party component vulnerabilities.", "Use of a valid backend user account for exploitation."]}
