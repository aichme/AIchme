{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe attachment file of an existing record can be replaced if the user has `\"read\"` permission on one of the parent (collection or bucket).\n\nAnd if the `\"read\"` permission is given to `\"system.Everyone\"` on one of the parent, then the attachment can be replaced on a record using an anonymous request.\n\nNote that if the parent has no explicit read permission, then the records attachments are safe.\n\n### Patches\n\n- Patch released in kinto-attachment 6.4.0\n- https://github.com/Kinto/kinto-attachment/commit/f4a31484f5925cbc02b59ebd37554538ab826ca1\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone if the read permission has to remain granted.\n\nUpdating to 6.4.0 or applying the patch individually (if updating is not feasible) is strongly recommended.\n\n### References\n\n- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1879034", "methods": ["An attacker can replace attachments on read-only records if the user has \"read\" permission on a parent collection or bucket.", "An attacker can replace attachments on records with \"read\" permission granted to \"system.Everyone\" on a parent, using an anonymous request.", "An attacker can exploit a vulnerability in kinto-attachment 6.3.0 and earlier."]}
