{"description": "gRPC contains a vulnerability whereby a client can cause a termination of connection between a HTTP2 proxy and a gRPC server: a base64 encoding error for `-bin` suffixed headers will result in a disconnection by the gRPC server, but is typically allowed by HTTP2 proxies. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit in\u00a0https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309.\n", "methods": ["Uses HTTP2 proxy to bypass gRPC server termination.", "Exploits base64 encoding error for `-bin` suffixed headers.", "Causes disconnection between HTTP2 proxy and gRPC server."]}
