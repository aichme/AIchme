{"description": "In FasterXML jackson-databind 2.4.0-rc1 until 2.12.7.1 and in 2.13.x before 2.13.4.2 resource exhaustion can occur because of a lack of a check in primitive value deserializers to avoid deep wrapper array nesting, when the UNWRAP_SINGLE_VALUE_ARRAYS feature is enabled. This was patched in 2.12.7.1, 2.13.4.2, and 2.14.0.\n\nCommits that introduced vulnerable code are \nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/d499f2e7bbc5ebd63af11e1f5cf1989fa323aa45, https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/0e37a39502439ecbaa1a5b5188387c01bf7f7fa1, and https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/7ba9ac5b87a9d6ac0d2815158ecbeb315ad4dcdc.\n\nFix commits are https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/cd090979b7ea78c75e4de8a4aed04f7e9fa8deea and https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/d78d00ee7b5245b93103fef3187f70543d67ca33.\n\nThe `2.13.4.1` release does fix this issue, however it also references a non-existent jackson-bom which causes build failures for gradle users. See https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3627#issuecomment-1277957548 for details. This is fixed in `2.13.4.2` which is listed in the advisory metadata so that users are not subjected to unnecessary build failures", "methods": ["None of the techniques are applicable in this CVE description."]}
