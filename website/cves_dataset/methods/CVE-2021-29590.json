{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementations of the `Minimum` and `Maximum` TFLite operators can be used to read data outside of bounds of heap allocated objects, if any of the two input tensor arguments are empty.\n\nThis is because [the broadcasting implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0d45ea1ca641b21b73bcf9c00e0179cda284e7e7/tensorflow/lite/kernels/internal/reference/maximum_minimum.h#L52-L56) indexes in both tensors with the same index but does not validate that the index is within bounds:\n\n```cc\nauto maxmin_func = [&](int indexes[N]) {\n  output_data[SubscriptToIndex(output_desc, indexes)] =\n    op(input1_data[SubscriptToIndex(desc1, indexes)],\n        input2_data[SubscriptToIndex(desc2, indexes)]);\n};\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [953f28dca13c92839ba389c055587cfe6c723578](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/953f28dca13c92839ba389c055587cfe6c723578).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB read in TFLite's implementation of `Minimum` or `Maximum` operators.", "Used a vulnerability in TensorFlow to read data outside of bounds of heap allocated objects.", "Used a GitHub commit to patch the issue.", "Cherrypicked the patch on multiple versions of TensorFlow."]}
