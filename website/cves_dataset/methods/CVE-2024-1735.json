{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe SAML implementation provided by `armeria-saml` currently accepts unsigned SAML messages (assertions, logout requests, etc.) as they are, rather than rejecting them by default. As a result, an attacker can forge a SAML message to authenticate themselves, despite the fact that such an unsigned SAML message should be rejected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Armeria version 1.27.2. All users who rely on `armeria-saml` older than version 1.27.2 must upgrade to 1.27.2 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no known workaround for this vulnerability.\n\n### References\n\n[`SamlMessageUtil.validateSignature()`](https://github.com/line/armeria/blob/0efc776988d71be4da6e506ec8a33c2b7b43f567/saml/src/main/java/com/linecorp/armeria/server/saml/SamlMessageUtil.java#L160-L163)", "methods": ["Bypassing authentication by forging a SAML message.", "Accepting unsigned SAML messages."]}
