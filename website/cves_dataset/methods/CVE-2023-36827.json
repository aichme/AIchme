{"description": "### Impact\nA path traversal (directory traversal) vulnerability affects fides versions lower than `2.15.1`, allowing remote attackers to access arbitrary files on the fides webserver container's filesystem.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability is patched in fides `2.15.1`. Users should upgrade to this version.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf the Fides webserver API is not directly accessible to attackers and is instead deployed behind a reverse proxy as recommended in Ethyca's [security best practice documentation](https://docs.ethyca.com/docs/configuration/security-practices#reverse-proxy), and the reverse proxy is an AWS application load balancer, the vulnerability can't be exploited by these attackers. An AWS application load balancer will reject this attack with a 400 error.\n\nAdditionally, any secrets supplied to the container using environment variables rather than a `fides.toml` configuration file are not affected by this vulnerability.\n", "methods": ["Used path traversal to access arbitrary files on the fides webserver container's filesystem.", "Exploited a webserver API vulnerability to access sensitive data.", "Used a reverse proxy to bypass the vulnerability.", "Used environment variables to prevent exploitation.", "Exploited a vulnerability in a specific version of fides (lower than 2.15.1)."]}
