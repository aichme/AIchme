{"description": "### Summary\nThe custom action behind WiX's `RemoveFolderEx` functionality could allow a standard user to delete protected directories.\n\n### Details\n`RemoveFolderEx` deletes an entire directory tree during installation or uninstallation. It does so by recursing every subdirectory starting at a specified directory and adding each subdirectory to the list of directories Windows Installer should delete. If the setup author instructed `RemoveFolderEx` to delete a per-user folder from a per-machine installer, an attacker could create a directory junction in that per-user folder pointing to a per-machine, protected directory. Windows Installer, when executing the per-machine installer after approval by an administrator, would delete the target of the directory junction.\n", "methods": ["Created a directory junction to a protected directory.", "Used Windows Installer to delete a protected directory.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the `RemoveFolderEx` functionality."]}
