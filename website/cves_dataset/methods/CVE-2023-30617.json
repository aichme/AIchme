{"description": "### Impact\nAttacker that has gain root privilege of the node that kruise-daemon run , can leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list all secrets in the entire cluster. After that, attackers can leverage the \"captured\" secrets (e.g. the kruise-manager service account token) to gain extra privilege such as pod modification. \n\n### Workarounds\nFor users that do not require imagepulljob functions, they can modify kruise-daemon-role to drop the cluster level secret get/list privilege \n\n### Patches\n\nFor users who're using v0.8.x ~ v1.2.x, please update the v1.3.1\nFor users who're using v1.3, please update the v1.3.1\nFor users who're using v1.4, please update the v1.4.1\nFor users who're using v1.5, please update the v1.5.2\n### References\nNone", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in Kruise to list all secrets in the entire cluster.", "Leveraged the kruise-daemon pod to gain extra privilege such as pod modification.", "Used the kruise-manager service account token to gain extra privilege.", "Modified the kruise-daemon-role to drop the cluster level secret get/list privilege.", "Updated to version 1.3.1 to patch the vulnerability.", "Updated to version 1.4.1 to patch the vulnerability.", "Updated to version 1.5.2 to patch the vulnerability."]}
