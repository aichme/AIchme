{"description": "Description\n-----------\n\nThe Symfony HTTP cache system acts as a reverse proxy: it caches HTTP responses (including headers) and returns them to clients.\n\nIn a recent `AbstractSessionListener` change, the response might now contain a `Set-Cookie` header. If the Symfony HTTP cache system is enabled, this header might be stored and returned to some other clients. An attacker can use this vulnerability to retrieve the victim's session.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nThe `HttpStore` constructor now takes a parameter containing a list of private headers that are removed from the HTTP response headers.\nThe default value for this parameter is `Set-Cookie`, but it can be overridden or extended by the application.\n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/d2f6322af9444ac5cd1ef3ac6f280dbef7f9d1fb) for branch 4.4.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nWe would like to thank Soner Sayakci for reporting the issue and Nicolas Grekas for fixing it.\n", "methods": ["Used a web application vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information (session data).", "Stored sensitive information (session data) in a cache.", "Used a reverse proxy to return cached responses to clients.", "Used a web application vulnerability to obtain sensitive information."]}
