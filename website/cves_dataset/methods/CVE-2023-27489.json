{"description": "### Impact\nKiwi TCMS accepts SVG files uploaded by users which could potentially contain JavaScript code. If SVG images are viewed directly, i.e. not rendered in an HTML page, this JavaScript code could execute. \n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been fixed by configuring Kiwi TCMS to serve with the Content-Security-Policy HTTP header which blocks inline JavaScript in all modern browsers.\n\n### Workarounds\nConfigure Content-Security-Policy header, see [commit 6617cee0](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/commit/6617cee0fb70cc394b7be6bbc86ef84e6e9de077).\n\n### References\nYou can visit https://digi.ninja/blog/svg_xss.php for more technical details.\n\nIndependently disclosed by [Antonio Spataro](https://huntr.dev/bounties/bf99001b-a0a2-4f7d-98cd-983bc7f14a69/) and [@1d8](https://huntr.dev/bounties/f8c73bcc-02f3-4c65-a92b-1caa4d67c2fd/).", "methods": ["Uses a stored XSS vulnerability in SVG files to execute JavaScript code.", "Uses JavaScript code in SVG files to execute when viewed directly.", "Uses a Content-Security-Policy HTTP header to block inline JavaScript.", "Configures the Content-Security-Policy header to prevent XSS attacks.", "Uses a commit to configure the Content-Security-Policy header."]}
