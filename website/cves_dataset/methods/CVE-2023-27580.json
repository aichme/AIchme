{"description": "### Impact\nAn improper implementation was found in the password storage process.\n\nAll hashed passwords stored in Shield v1.0.0-beta.3 or earlier are easier to crack than expected due to the vulnerability. Therefore, they should be removed as soon as possible.\n\nIf an attacker gets (1) the user's hashed password by Shield, and (2) the hashed password (SHA-384 hash without salt) from somewhere, the attacker may easily crack the user's password.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Shield v1.0.0-beta.4 or later.\n\nAfter upgrading, all users\u2019 hashed passwords should be updated (saved to the database).\nSee https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/blob/develop/UPGRADING.md for details.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n- https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#pre-hashing-passwords\n- https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2015/03/security-issue-combining-bcrypt-with.html\n- https://www.scottbrady91.com/authentication/beware-of-password-shucking\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue or discussion in [codeigniter4/shield](https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield)\n* Email us at [security@codeigniter.com](mailto:security@codeigniter.com)\n", "methods": ["Stored Hashed Passwords in a Weak Format (SHA-384 hash without salt).", "Password Hashing Weakness (improper implementation).", "Password Hashing Without Salts.", "Password Hashing Without Iterations.", "Password Hashing Without Key Stretching."]}
