{"description": "A sandbox bypass vulnerability exists in Jenkins Groovy Plugin 2.0 and earlier in `src/main/java/hudson/plugins/groovy/StringScriptSource.java` that allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to provide a Groovy script to an HTTP endpoint that can result in arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins master JVM. In version 2.1, the affected HTTP endpoint applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.", "methods": ["Used a sandbox bypass vulnerability in Jenkins Groovy Plugin to execute arbitrary code.", "Executed code on the Jenkins master JVM.", "Used a Groovy script to bypass sandbox restrictions.", "Used an HTTP endpoint to deliver the malicious script.", "Used unsafe AST transforming annotations to execute malicious code."]}
