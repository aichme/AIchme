{"description": "### Impact\nFor regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload.\n\n### Patches\nRemove session token from LiveQuery payload.\n\n### Workaround\nSet `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.", "methods": ["Uses a vulnerable API to publish user session tokens in LiveQuery payloads.", "Fails to remove session tokens from LiveQuery responses.", "Uses a beforeSave trigger to make users private on sign-up."]}
