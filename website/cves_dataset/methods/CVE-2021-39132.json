{"description": "### Impact\n\nAn authorized user can upload a zip-format plugin with a crafted plugin.yaml, or a crafted aclpolicy yaml file, or upload an untrusted project archive with a crafted aclpolicy yaml file, that can cause the server to run untrusted code on Rundeck Community or Enterprise Edition.  An authenticated user can make a POST request, that can cause the server to run untrusted code on Rundeck Enterprise Edition.\n\nThe zip-format plugin issues requires authentication and authorization to these access levels, and affects all Rundeck editions:\n\n* `admin` level access to the `system` resource type\n\nThe ACL Policy yaml file upload issues requires authentication and authorization to these access levels, and affects all Rundeck editions: \n\n* `create` `update` or `admin` level access to a `project_acl` resource\n* `create` `update` or `admin` level access to the `system_acl` resource\n\nThe unauthorized POST request requires authentication, but no specific authorization, and affects Rundeck Enterprise only.\n\n### Patches\nVersions 3.4.3, 3.3.14\n\n### Workarounds\n\nPlease visit [https://rundeck.com/security](https://rundeck.com/security) for information about specific workarounds.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@rundeck.com](mailto:security@rundeck.com)\n\nTo report security issues to Rundeck please use the form at [https://rundeck.com/security](https://rundeck.com/security)\n\nReporter: Rojan Rijal from Tinder Red Team", "methods": ["YAML deserialization to run untrusted code.", "Upload of untrusted code via zip-format plugin.", "Upload of untrusted code via ACL Policy yaml file.", "Unauthenticated POST request to run untrusted code.", "Authentication bypass via authentication and authorization vulnerabilities.", "Execution of untrusted code via Rundeck Community or Enterprise Edition."]}
