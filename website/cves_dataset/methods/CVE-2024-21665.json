{"description": "### Summary\nAn authenticated and unauthorized user can access the back-office orders list and be able to query over the information returned.\n\n### Details\nPermissions do not seem to be enforced when reaching the `admin/ecommerceframework/admin-order/list` endpoint allowing an authenticated user without the permissions to access the endpoint and query the data available there. It seems that the access control is not enforced in this place :\n\n<https://github.com/pimcore/ecommerce-framework-bundle/blob/ff6ff287b6eb468bb940909c56970363596e5c21/src/Controller/AdminOrderController.php#L98>\n\n__Note__ :  Testing this vulnerability requires a fully configured ecommerce website, but it looks vulnerable as when requesting the endpoint the data seem returned (and when looking at the source code nothing seems to validate the permissions on the specified endpoint).\n\n### PoC\nIn order to reproduce the issue, the following steps can be followed :\n\n1.  As an administrator :\n  a. Create a role without any permission through Settings \u2192 User & Roles \u2192 Roles in the administration panel\n  b. Create an user through Settings \u2192 User & Roles \u2192 Users and assign it the unprivileged role previously created\n2. Log out the current administrator and log in with this new user\n3. Access to the following endpoint `https://pimcore_instance/admin/ecommerceframework/admin-order/list` and the results will be returned to this unauthorized user\n\n### Impact\nAn unauthorized user can access back-office orders without being authorized to.\n", "methods": ["Access to unauthorized data is possible through an endpoint without proper access control.", "An authenticated user without permissions can access the back-office orders list.", "Permissions are not enforced for the `admin/ecommerceframework/admin-order/list` endpoint.", "An unprivileged user can query data from the endpoint."]}
