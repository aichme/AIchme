{"description": "### Impact\nAll users who run Spring Boot Admin Server, having enabled Notifiers (e.g. Teams-Notifier) and write access to environment variables via UI are possibly affected.\n\n### Patches\nIn the most recent releases of Spring Boot Admin 2.6.10 and 2.7.8 the issue is fixed by implementing `SimpleExecutionContext` of SpEL. This prevents the arbitrary code execution (i.e. SpEL injection).\n\n### Workarounds\n * Disable any notifier\n * Disable write access (POST request) on `/env` actuator endpoint\n\n", "methods": ["Arbitrary code execution via SpEL injection.", "Use of environment variables for code execution.", "Use of UI for code execution.", "Use of POST requests for code execution.", "Use of actuator endpoint for code execution."]}
