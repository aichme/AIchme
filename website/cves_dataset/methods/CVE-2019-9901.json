{"description": "Envoy 1.9.0 and before does not normalize HTTP URL paths. A remote attacker may craft a relative path, e.g., `something/../admin`, to bypass access control, e.g., a block on `/admin`. A backend server could then interpret the non-normalized path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy.", "methods": ["Bypass User Account Control (UAC) by exploiting a vulnerability in URL path normalization.", "Lateral Movement by accessing unauthorized paths.", "Bypass Access Control by exploiting a vulnerability in URL path normalization."]}
