{"description": "Versions of `iobroker.controller` prior to 2.0.25 are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to restrict access to folders outside of the intended `/adapter/<adapter-name>` folder, which may allow attackers to include arbitrary files in the system. An attacker would need to be authenticated to perform the attack but the package has authentication disabled by default.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.0.25 or later.", "methods": ["Used Path Traversal to write arbitrary files.", "Failed to restrict access to folders outside of the intended path.", "Enabled authentication bypass due to default authentication disabled."]}
