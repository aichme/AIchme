{"description": "### Impact\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor via the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 4.9.10 or lower and TinyMCE 5.4.0 or lower.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 4.9.11 and 5.4.1 by improved HTML parsing and sanitization logic.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe workarounds available are:\n- upgrade to either TinyMCE 4.9.11 or TinyMCE 5.4.1\nor\n- enable the media plugin, which overrides the default parsing behaviour for iframes\nor\n- add the following workaround to update the parsing schema rules for iframes:\n\n#### Example: Change the default schema for iframes\n```js\nsetup: function(editor) {\n  editor.on('PreInit', function() {\n    editor.schema.getSpecialElements()['iframe'] = /</iframe[^>]*>/gi;\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\nTiny Technologies would like to thank George Steketee and Chris Davis at [Bishop Fox](https://www.bishopfox.com/) for discovering this vulnerability.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes54/#securityfixes\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [TinyMCE repo](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues)\n* Email us at [infosec@tiny.cloud](mailto:infosec@tiny.cloud)", "methods": ["Used cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in TinyMCE.", "Executed arbitrary JavaScript code.", "Inserted specially crafted content into the editor via the clipboard or APIs.", "Impacted users of TinyMCE 4.9.10 or lower and TinyMCE 5.4.0 or lower.", "Patched in TinyMCE 4.9.11 and 5.4.1 with improved HTML parsing and sanitization logic.", "Workarounds include upgrading to TinyMCE 4.9.11 or 5.4.1, enabling the media plugin, or adding a workaround to update parsing schema rules for iframes."]}
