This affects installations which allowed upload folder protection via the optional silverstripe/secureassets module under 3.x. This module is installed and enabled by default on the Common Web Platform (CWP). The vulnerability only affects files uploaded after an upgrade to 4.x.", "methods": ["Used an insecure upload feature to upload files to the default \"/Uploads\" folder.", "Failed to properly handle file uploads from migrated folders.", "Leveraged a module not installed/enabled by default in the new version."]}
