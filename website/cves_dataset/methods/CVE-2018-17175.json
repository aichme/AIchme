{"description": "In the marshmallow library before 2.15.1 and 3.x before 3.0.0b9 for Python, the schema \"only\" option treats an empty list as implying no \"only\" option, which allows a request that was intended to expose no fields to instead expose all fields (if the schema is being filtered dynamically using the \"only\" option, and there is a user role that produces an empty value for \"only\").", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the marshmallow library to expose all fields in a schema when an empty list is used with the \"only\" option.", "Failed to properly validate user input for the \"only\" option, allowing a malicious user to expose all fields."]}
