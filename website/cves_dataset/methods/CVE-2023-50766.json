{"description": "Jenkins Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.0-03 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.\n\nAdditionally, the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, so attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nAdditionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nNexus Platform Plugin 3.18.1-01 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.\n\nAdditionally, POST requests and Overall/Administer permission are required for the affected HTTP endpoints.", "methods": ["Used a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability to send HTTP requests to an attacker-specified URL.", "Used XML external entity (XXE) attacks to parse crafted XML responses and extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.", "Used a vulnerability in form validation to bypass permission checks.", "Used Overall/Read permission to access affected HTTP endpoints.", "Used Overall/Administer permission to access affected HTTP endpoints.", "Used POST requests to access affected HTTP endpoints."]}
