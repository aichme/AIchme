{"description": "Apache Ignite 2.5 and earlier serialization mechanism does not have a list of classes allowed for serialization/deserialization, which makes it possible to run arbitrary code when 3-rd party vulnerable classes are present in Ignite classpath. The vulnerability can be exploited if the one sends a specially prepared form of a serialized object to GridClientJdkMarshaller deserialization endpoint.", "methods": ["Used deserialization to execute arbitrary code.", "Exploited a vulnerable class in the classpath.", "Used a specially prepared serialized object to exploit the vulnerability.", "Exploited a deserialization endpoint."]}
