This vulnerability only impacts unix-like systems where the local system temporary directory is shared between all users. This vulnerability does not impact Windows or modern versions of MacOS.\n\nOpenAPI Generator Maven plug-in creates insecure temporary files during the code generation process. It creates insecure temporary files to store the OpenAPI specification files provided by the users and these temporary files can be read by any users in the system.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is information disclosure of the contents of the specification file to other local users.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been patched with `Files.createTempFile` and released in the v5.1.0 stable version.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [OpenAPI Generator Github repo](https://github.com/openAPITools/openapi-generator/)\n* Email us at [security@openapitools.org](mailto:security@openapitools.org)", "methods": ["Creates temporary files in a directory with insecure permissions.", "Creates temporary files that can be read by other local users.", "Uses `File.createTempFile` in JDK to create temporary files.", "Creates temporary files to store OpenAPI specification files.", "Stores sensitive data in insecure temporary files."]}
