{"description": "### Impact\nUsers hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to remote code execution allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to version 3.14.1 where the \"Custom Filter\" input is turned off by default. You can find out more information on how to turn it back on [here](https://github.com/man-group/dtale#custom-filter)\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only workaround for versions earlier than 3.14.1 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.\n\n### References\nSee \"Custom Filter\" [documentation](https://github.com/man-group/dtale#custom-filter)\n", "methods": ["Remote Code Execution through the Query input on Chart Builder.", "Host D-Tale to trusted users.", "Upgrade to version 3.14.1 to turn off the \"Custom Filter\" input by default."]}
