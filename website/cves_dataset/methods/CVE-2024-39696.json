{"description": "### Summary\n\nThis advisory board aims to describe two vulnerabilities found in the Evmos codebase:\n\n- _Authorization check on the fundVestingAccount_: unauthorized spend of funds.\n\n### Details\n\n#### Authorization check on the fundVestingAccount\n\nWith the current implementation, a user can create a vesting account with a 3rd party account (EOA or contract) as funder. Then, this user can create an authorization for the contract.CallerAddress, this is the authorization checked in the code. But the funds are taken from the funder address provided in the message. Consequently, the user can fund a vesting account with a 3rd party account without its permission.
