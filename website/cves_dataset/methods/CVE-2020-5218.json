{"description": "### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability gives the ability to switch channels via the `_channel_code` GET parameter in production environments. This was meant to be enabled only when `%kernel.debug%` is set to true. \n\nHowever, if no `sylius_channel.debug` is set explicitly in the configuration, the default value which is `%kernel.debug%` will be not resolved and cast to boolean, enabling this debug feature even if that parameter is set to false.\n\n### Patches\n\nPatch has been provided for Sylius 1.3.x and newer - **1.3.16, 1.4.12, 1.5.9, 1.6.5**. Versions older than 1.3 are not covered by our security support anymore.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUnsupported versions could be patched by adding the following configuration to run in production:\n\n```yaml\nsylius_channel:\n    debug: false\n```", "methods": ["Enabled debug feature via GET parameter in production environments.", "Failed to resolve and cast configuration parameter to boolean.", "Added configuration to disable debug feature in production environments."]}
