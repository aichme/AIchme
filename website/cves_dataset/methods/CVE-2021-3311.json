{"description": "### Impact\nWhen logging out, the session ID was not invalidated. This is not a problem while the user is logged out, but as soon as the user logs back in the old session ID would be valid again; which means that anyone that gained access to the old session cookie would be able to act as the logged in user. This is not a major concern for the majority of cases, since it requires a malicious party gaining access to the session cookie in the first place, but nevertheless has been fixed.\n\n### Patches\nIssue has been patched in Build 472 (v1.0.472) and v1.1.2.\n\n### Workarounds\nApply https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/642f597489e6f644d4bd9a0c267e864cabead024 to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 472 or v1.1.2.\n\n### References\n- Reported by Anisio (Brazilian Information Security Analyst)\n- http://cve.circl.lu/cve/CVE-2021-3311\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)\n\n### Threat assessment:\n<img width=\"699\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-02-07 at 11 50 35 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7253840/107180881-51eaf000-699f-11eb-8828-333128faf2a6.png\">", "methods": ["Used session ID not invalidated after logout to maintain unauthorized access.", "Used session cookie to gain unauthorized access to user account.", "Used manual patching to fix the vulnerability.", "Used manual code modification to apply a patch."]}
