{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe annotation displayer does not execute the content in a restricted context. This allows executing anything with the right of the author of any document by annotating the document.\n\nTo reproduce: add an annotation with the content `{{groovy}}print \"hello\"{{/groovy}}` and click the yellow scare to get a display of the annotation inline.\n\nThe result is \"hello\" but it should be an error suggesting that it's not allowed to use the groovy macro.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no easy workaround except to upgrade.\n\n### References\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20360\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20384\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n\n### Attribution\n\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ren\u00e9 de Sain @renniepak.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the XWiki-platform to execute arbitrary code.", "Executed arbitrary code in a restricted context."]}
