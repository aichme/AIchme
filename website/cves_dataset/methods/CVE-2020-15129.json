{"description": "## Summary\n\nThere exists a potential open redirect vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header. Active Exploitation of this issue is unlikely as it would require active header injection, however the Traefik team addressed this issue nonetheless to prevent abuse in e.g. cache poisoning scenarios.\n\n## Details\n\nThe Traefik API dashboard component doesn't validate that the value of the header `X-Forwarded-Prefix` is a site relative path and will redirect to any header provided URI.\n\ne.g.\n\n```\n$ curl --header 'Host:traefik.localhost' --header 'X-Forwarded-Prefix:https://example.org' 'http://localhost:8081'\n<a href=\"https://example.org/dashboard/\">Found</a>.`\n```\n\n### Impact\nA successful exploitation of an open redirect can be used to entice victims to disclose sensitive information.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nBy using the `headers` middleware, the request header `X-Forwarded-Prefix` value can be overridden by the value `.` (dot)\n\n- https://docs.traefik.io/v2.2/middlewares/headers/#customrequestheaders\n- https://docs.traefik.io/v1.7/basics/#custom-headers\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, open an issue in [Traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik/issues).\n\n## Credit\n\nThis issue was found by the GitHub Application Security Team and reported on behalf of the GHAS by the GitHub Security Lab Team.", "methods": ["Used open redirect to entice victims to disclose sensitive information.", "Injected malicious headers to manipulate the Traefik API dashboard.", "Exploited the lack of validation of the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header value.", "Used the `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header to redirect to any provided URI."]}
