A user with elevated privileges could upload a photo to the system in an SVG format. This file will be uploaded to the system and it will not be stripped or filtered. The user can create a link on the website pointing to \"/storage/poc.svg\" that will point to http://localhost/pagekit/storage/poc.svg. When a user comes along to click that link, it will trigger a XSS attack.", "methods": ["Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via SVG file upload.", "Used a web application vulnerability to upload malicious code.", "Used a web application to store and serve malicious code.", "Created a malicious link to trigger the XSS attack.", "Used a user with elevated privileges to upload malicious content."]}
