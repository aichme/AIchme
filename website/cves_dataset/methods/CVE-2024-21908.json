{"description": "### Impact\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.9.0 by ensuring schema validation was still performed after unwrapping invalid elements.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo work around this vulnerability, either:\n- Upgrade to TinyMCE 5.9.0 or higher\n- Manually sanitize the content using the `BeforeSetContent` event (see below)\n\n#### Example: Manually sanitize content\n```js\neditor.on('BeforeSetContent', function(e) {\n  var sanitizedContent = ...; // Manually sanitize content here\n  e.content = sanitizedContent;\n});\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\nTiny Technologies would like to thank William Bowling for discovering this vulnerability.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes59/#securityfixes\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [infosec@tiny.cloud](mailto:infosec@tiny.cloud)\n* Open an issue in the [TinyMCE repo](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues)", "methods": ["Used cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in TinyMCE.", "Executed arbitrary JavaScript code.", "Inserted malicious content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs.", "Published malicious content outside the editor without server-side sanitization.", "Used schema validation logic vulnerability to execute malicious code.", "Used the `BeforeSetContent` event to manually sanitize content."]}
