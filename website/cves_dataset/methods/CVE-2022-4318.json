{"description": "### Impact\nIt is possible to craft an environment variable with newlines to add entries to a container's /etc/passwd. It is possible to circumvent admission validation of username/UID by adding such an entry.\n\nNote: because the pod author is in control of the container's /etc/passwd, this is not considered a new risk factor. However, this advisory is being opened for transparency and as a way of tracking fixes.\n\n### Patches\n1.26.0 will have the fix. More patches will be posted as they're available.\n\n### Workarounds\nAdditional security controls like SELinux should prevent any damage a container is able to do with root on the host. Using SELinux is recommended because this class of attack is already possible by manually editing the container's /etc/passwd \n\n### References\n", "methods": ["Tampered with /etc/passwd to gain Privilege Escalation.", "Added entries to a container's /etc/passwd to circumvent admission validation.", "Used environment variables with newlines to add entries to /etc/passwd.", "Manually edited the container's /etc/passwd to gain root access."]}
