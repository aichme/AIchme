{"description": "### Impact\n\nAttackers can specify a specific string of characters, which would confuse the bridge into combining an attacker-owned channel and an existing channel, allowing them to grant themselves permissions in the channel.\n\n### Patched\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisable dynamic channel joining via `dynamicChannels.enabled` to prevent users from joining new channels, which prevents any new channels being bridged outside of what is already bridged, and what is specified in the config.\n\n### References\n\n- https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/13/security-release-of-matrix-appservice-irc-0-35-0-high-severity\n\n### Credits\n\nDiscovered and reported by [Val Lorentz](https://valentin-lorentz.fr/).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).", "methods": ["Used a parsing issue in matrix-org/node-irc to take over rooms.", "Used a string of characters to confuse the bridge into combining an attacker-owned channel and an existing channel.", "Used dynamic channel joining to join new channels and bridge them outside of the config.", "Used a config setting to disable dynamic channel joining to prevent users from joining new channels."]}
