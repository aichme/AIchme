{"description": "### Impact\n\nAn authenticated backend user with the `editor.cms_pages`, `editor.cms_layouts`, or `editor.cms_partials` permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.safe_mode` being enabled can write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP.\n\nThis is not a problem for anyone who trusts their users with those permissions to usually write and manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.safe_mode` enabled. Still, it would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.safe_mode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write and execute arbitrary PHP.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in v3.4.15.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a workaround, remove the specified permissions from untrusted users.\n\n### References\n\nCredits to:\n- [Vasiliy Bodrov](https://github.com/whatev3n)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in October CMS to bypass safe mode and execute arbitrary PHP code.", "Escaped the Twig sandbox to execute arbitrary PHP.", "Executed arbitrary PHP code due to insufficient permission checks.", "Leveraged a vulnerability in October CMS to write and execute PHP code."]}
