{"description": "The twitter-bootstrap-rails Gem for Rails contains a flaw that enables a\nreflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This flaw exists because the\nbootstrap_flash helper method does not validate input when handling flash\nmessages before returning it to users. This may allow a context-dependent\nattacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary\nscript code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between\ntheir browser and the server.\n", "methods": ["Used reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session.", "Failed to validate input when handling flash messages."]}
