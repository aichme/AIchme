{"description": "The fix for CVE-2023-24998 was incomplete. If non-default HTTP connector settings were used such that the maxParameterCount could be reached using query string parameters and a request was submitted that supplied exactly maxParameterCount parameters in the query string, the limit for uploaded request parts could be bypassed with the potential for a denial of service to occur.", "methods": ["Bypassed a security feature by exploiting a limit in query string parameters.", "Caused a denial of service by submitting a request with a large number of parameters."]}
