Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.", "methods": ["Used a missing permission check in the Jenkins Artifactory Plugin to capture credentials.", "Used credentials IDs to capture credentials.", "Used another vulnerability to capture credentials."]}
