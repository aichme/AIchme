{"description": "A malicious actor can read arbitrary files from a client that uses ruby-mysql to communicate to a rogue MySQL server and issue database queries. In these cases, the server has the option to create a database reply using the LOAD DATA LOCAL statement, which instructs the client to provide additional data from a local file readable by the client (and not a \"local\" file on the server).", "methods": ["Used an externally controlled resource to read arbitrary files from a client.", "Used a database to issue commands to the client.", "Leveraged a database query to instruct the client to read a local file."]}
