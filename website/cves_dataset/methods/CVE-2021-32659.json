{"description": "### Impact\n\nIf a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any mailcious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware.\n\n\n### Patches\n\nVersions 2.6.1 and greater are patched.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options. \n\n### References\n\nThe issue is patched by https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/330\n\n### For more information]\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at security@matrix.org.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in automatic room upgrade handling to bridge a room non-consentually.", "Used a malicious admin to repoint traffic to a different room without the new room being aware.", "Used a malicious admin to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room."]}
