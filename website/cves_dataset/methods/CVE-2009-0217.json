{"description": "The design of the W3C XML Signature Syntax and Processing (XMLDsig) recommendation, as implemented in multiple products.\n\nThe Apache XML Security (Java) is affected by the vulnerability published in US-Cert VU #466161. See: http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/466161 for more information. This bug can allow an attacker to bypass authentication by inserting/modifying a small HMAC truncation length parameter in the XML Signature HMAC based SignatureMethod algorithms.\n\nAn inexhaustive list of additional affected products includes:  \n1. the Oracle Security Developer Tools component in Oracle Application Server 10.1.2.3, 10.1.3.4, and 10.1.4.3IM; \n2. the WebLogic Server component in BEA Product Suite 10.3, 10.0 MP1, 9.2 MP3, 9.1, 9.0, and 8.1 SP6; \n3. Mono before 2.4.2.2; \n4. XML Security Library before 1.2.12; \n5. IBM WebSphere Application Server Versions 6.0 through 6.0.2.33, 6.1 through 6.1.0.23, and 7.0 through 7.0.0.1; \n6. Sun JDK and JRE Update 14 and earlier; \n7. Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 through 3.0 SP2, 3.5, and 4.0; and other products uses a parameter that defines an HMAC truncation length (HMACOutputLength) but does not require a minimum for this length, which allows attackers to spoof HMAC-based signatures and bypass authentication by specifying a truncation length with a small number of bits.", "methods": ["Spoofing: Spoofing HMAC-based signatures by specifying a truncation length with a small number of bits.", "Authentication Bypass: Bypass authentication by inserting/modifying a small HMAC truncation length parameter in the XML Signature HMAC based SignatureMethod algorithms."]}
