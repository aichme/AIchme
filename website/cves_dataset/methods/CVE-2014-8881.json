{"description": "All versions of the `bleach` package are vulnerable to a regular expression denial of service attack when certain types of input are passed into the sanitize function.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe `bleach` package is not currently maintained, and has not seen an update since 2014. \n\nTo mitigate this issue, it is necessary to use an alternative module that is actively maintained and provides similar functionality. There are [multiple modules fitting this criteria available on npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=html%20sanitizer&page=1&ranking=optimal).", "methods": ["None of the techniques are applicable as this is a vulnerability in a package, not an attack."]}
