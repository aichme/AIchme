{"description": "An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing functionality in the parse_yaml_query method in parser.py in MLAlchemy before 0.2.2. When processing YAML-Based queries for data, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used where safe_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used unsafe deserialization to execute arbitrary Python commands.", "Executed arbitrary Python commands through YAML parsing.", "Loaded malicious YAML to trigger command execution."]}
