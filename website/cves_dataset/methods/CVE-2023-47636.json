{"description": "### Impact\nFull Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see the path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/. Certain vulnerabilities, such as using the load_file() (within a SQL Injection) query to view the page source, require the attacker to have the full path to the file they wish to view.\n\nIn the case of pimcore, the fopen() function here doesn't have an error handle when the file doesn't exist on the server so the server response raises the full path \"fopen(/var/www/html/var/tmp/export-{ uniqe id}.csv)\"\n\n### Patches\nApply patch https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/10d178ef771097604a256c1192b098af9ec57a87.patch\n\n### Workarounds\nUpdate to version 1.2.1 or apply [patches](https://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/10d178ef771097604a256c1192b098af9ec57a87.patch) manually\n\n### References\nhttps://huntr.com/bounties/4af4db18-9fd4-43e9-8bc6-c88aaf76839c/", "methods": ["Used the fopen() function without error handling to disclose the full path to a file.", "Used the load_file() function within a SQL Injection query to view the page source.", "Used the fopen() function to view the page source."]}
