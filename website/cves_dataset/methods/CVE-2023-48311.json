{"description": "### Impact\n\nUsers of JupyterHub deployments running DockerSpawner starting with 0.11.0 without specifying `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` configuration allow users to launch _any_ pullable image, instead of restricting to only the single configured image, as intended.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to DockerSpawner 13.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nExplicitly setting `DockerSpawner.allowed_images` to a non-empty list containing only the default image will result in the intended default behavior:\n\n```python\nc.DockerSpawner.image = \"your-image\"\nc.DockerSpawner.allowed_images = [\"your-image\"]\n```\n", "methods": ["Allows any image to be launched by default.", "Allows users to launch any pullable image."]}
