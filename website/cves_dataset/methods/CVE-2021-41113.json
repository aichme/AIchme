However, it is not limited to the same site context and does not require the attacker to be authenticated. In a worst case scenario, the attacker could create a new admin user account to compromise the system.\n\nTo successfully carry out an attack, an attacker must trick his victim to access a compromised system. The victim must have an active session in the TYPO3 backend at that time.\n\nThe following [Same-Site cookie settings](https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/master/en-us/Changelog/8.7.x/Feature-90351-ConfigureTYPO3-shippedCookiesWithSameSiteFlag.html) in _$GLOBALS[TYPO3_CONF_VARS][BE][cookieSameSite]_ are required for an attack to be successful:\n\n* _SameSite=_***strict***: malicious evil.**example.org** invoking TYPO3 application at good.**example.org**\n* _SameSite=_***lax*** or ***none***: malicious **evil.com** invoking TYPO3 application at **example.org**\n\n### Solution\nUpdate your instance to TYPO3 version 11.5.0 which addresses the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Richie Lee who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team members Benni Mack and Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-014](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-014)\n* [CVE-2020-11069](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11069) reintroduced in TYPO3 v11.2.0", "methods": ["Used cross-site request forgery (CSRF) to create a new admin user account.", "Requires Same-Site cookie settings to be set to \"strict\" for an attack to be successful.", "Requires the victim to have an active session in the TYPO3 backend.", "Requires the victim to access a compromised system."]}
