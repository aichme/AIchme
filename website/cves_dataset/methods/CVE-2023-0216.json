{"description": "An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the `d2i_PKCS7()`, `d2i_PKCS7_bio()` or `d2i_PKCS7_fp()` functions.\n\nThe result of the dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call this function however third party applications might call these functions on untrusted data.\n", "methods": ["Triggered an application crash by loading malformed PKCS7 data.", "Exploited a denial of service vulnerability."]}
