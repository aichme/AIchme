{"description": "Parasoft Findings Plugin implements a static analysis parser for various Parasoft products and integrates with [Warnings Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings) (10.4.1 and earlier) and [Warnings NG Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng) (10.4.2 and newer).\n\nParasoft Findings Plugin 10.4.3 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user able to control the input files for the Parasoft Findings parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nParasoft Findings Plugin 10.4.4 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.", "methods": ["Used XXE vulnerability in Jenkins Parasoft Findings Plugin to extract secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.", "Used crafted files to manipulate the XML parser."]}
