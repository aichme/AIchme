{"description": "### Impact\n\nIn ghinstallation v1, when the request to refresh an installation token failed, the HTTP request and response would be returned for debugging.\n\nhttps://github.com/bradleyfalzon/ghinstallation/blob/24e56b3fb7669f209134a01eff731d7e2ef72a5c/transport.go#L172-L174\n\nThe request contained the bearer JWT for the App, and was returned back to clients. This token is short lived (10 minute maximum).\n\n### Patches\n\n- This has already been patched in d24f14f8be70d94129d76026e8b0f4f9170c8c3e, and is available in releases >= v2.0.0.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n- See https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/authenticating-with-github-apps#authenticating-as-an-installation for the App installation flow.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [ghinstallation](https://github.com/bradleyfalzon/ghinstallation)\n", "methods": ["Returned sensitive information in error responses.", "Returned bearer JWT in error responses.", "Returned HTTP request and response in error responses."]}
