{"description": "### Impact\nThe [shape inference functions for `SparseCountSparseOutput`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876/tensorflow/core/ops/count_ops.cc#L43-L50) can trigger a read outside of bounds of heap allocated array:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n@tf.function\ndef func():\n  return tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(\n    indices=[1],\n    values=[[1]],\n    dense_shape=[10],\n    weights=[],\n    binary_output= True)\n\nfunc()\n```\n\nThe function fails to check that the first input (i.e., `indices`) has rank 2:\n\n```cc\n  auto rank = c->Dim(c->input(0), 1);\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [701cfaca222a82afbeeb17496bd718baa65a67d2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/701cfaca222a82afbeeb17496bd718baa65a67d2).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB read in `tf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput`", "Triggering a read outside of bounds of heap allocated array", "Fails to check that the first input (i.e., `indices`) has rank 2"]}
