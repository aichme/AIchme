The vendor didn't check the return value of libxml2 API 'xmlDocGetRootElement', and try to dereference it. It is unsafe as the return value can be NULL and that NULL pointer dereference may crash the application.", "methods": ["Used a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in VTK.", "Failed to check the return value of a library function (libxml2 API 'xmlDocGetRootElement')."]}
