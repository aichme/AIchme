{"description": "### Description ###\n[GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2](https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-5mcr-gq6c-3hq2) (CVE-2021-21290) contains an insufficient fix for the vulnerability identified.\n\n### Impact ###\n\nWhen netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled.\n\nThis only impacts applications running on Java version 6 and lower. Additionally, this vulnerability impacts code running on Unix-like systems, and very old versions of Mac OSX and Windows as they all share the system temporary directory between all users.\n\n### Vulnerability Details ###\n\nTo fix the vulnerability the code was changed to the following:\n\n```java\n    @SuppressJava6Requirement(reason = \"Guarded by version check\")\n    public static File createTempFile(String prefix, String suffix, File directory) throws IOException {\n        if (javaVersion() >= 7) {\n            if (directory == null) {\n                return Files.createTempFile(prefix, suffix).toFile();\n            }\n            return Files.createTempFile(directory.toPath(), prefix, suffix).toFile();\n        }\n        if (directory == null) {\n            return File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);\n        }\n        File file = File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix, directory);\n        // Try to adjust the perms, if this fails there is not much else we can do...\n        file.setReadable(false, false);\n        file.setReadable(true, true);\n        return file;\n    }\n```\n\nUnfortunately, this logic path was left vulnerable:\n\n```java\n        if (directory == null) {\n            return File.createTempFile(prefix, suffix);\n        }\n```\n\nThis file is still readable by all local users.\n\n### Patches ###\n\nUpdate to 4.1.77.Final\n\n### Workarounds ###\n\nSpecify your own `java.io.tmpdir` when you start the JVM or use `DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)` to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user or update to Java 7 or above.\n\n### References ###\n\n - [CWE-378: Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/378.html)\n - [CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html)\n\n\n### For more information ###\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in [netty](https://github.com/netty/netty)\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable version of Java (version 6 and lower) to create temporary files with insecure permissions.", "Created temporary files in the system temporary directory, which is shared among all users.", "Failed to properly set permissions on temporary files, making them readable by all local users.", "Used the `File.createTempFile` method to create temporary files without specifying a custom directory.", "Failed to update the code to use the fixed version (4.1.77.Final) to prevent the vulnerability.", "Failed to implement a workaround by specifying a custom `java.io.tmpdir` or using `DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir` to set a secure directory."]}
