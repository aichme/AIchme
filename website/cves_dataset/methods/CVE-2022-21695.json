{"description": "Between September 26, 2021 and October 8, 2021, [Radically Open Security](https://www.radicallyopensecurity.com/) conducted a penetration test of OnionShare 2.4, funded by the Open Technology Fund's [Red Team lab](https://www.opentech.fund/labs/red-team-lab/). This is an issue from that penetration test.\n\n- Vulnerability ID: OTF-009\n- Vulnerability type: Improper Access Control\n- Threat level: Low\n\n## Description:\n\nAuthenticated users (or unauthenticated in public mode) can send messages without being visible in the list of chat participants.\n\n## Technical description:\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n- Existing chatroom\n- Access to the chatroom (Public or known Private Key)\n- Either a modified frontend client or manual requests from burp/curl\n\nIf a user opens the chatroom without emitting the join message he will not be present in session.users[x] list. Therefore there is no listing in the frontend and no chat participant knows another party joined the chat. It is still possible to send messages in the chatroom.\n\nIf a user decides to abuse OTF-003 (page 22) he can impersonate messages from existing users; others would not be able to distinguish original and faked messages. This is also a prerequisite for OTF-004 (page 19).\n\n## Impact:\n\nAn adversary with access to the chat environment can send messages to the chat without being visible in the list of chat participants.\n\n## Recommendation:\n\n- Allow chat access only after emission of the join event.\n- Implement proper session handling.", "methods": ["Impersonation of existing users to send messages in the chatroom.", "Sending messages without being visible in the list of chat participants.", "Abuse of OTF-003 to impersonate messages from existing users.", "Lack of proper session handling.", "Impersonation of messages from existing users to make them indistinguishable from original messages."]}
