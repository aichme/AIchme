{"description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39148](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39148.html).\n\n### Credits\nwh1t3p1g from TSRC (Tencent Security Response Center) found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n", "methods": ["An attacker can execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream.", "An attacker can load and execute arbitrary code remotely.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code without user interaction.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code by manipulating the input stream.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code remotely."]}
