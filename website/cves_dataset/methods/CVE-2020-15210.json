{"description": "### Impact\nIf a TFLite saved model uses the same tensor as both input and output of an operator, then, depending on the operator, we can observe a segmentation fault or just memory corruption.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in d58c96946b and will release patch releases for all versions between 1.15 and 2.3.\n\nWe recommend users to upgrade to TensorFlow 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nA potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that no operator reuses tensors as both inputs and outputs. Care should be taken to check all types of inputs (i.e., constant or variable tensors as well as optional tensors).\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been discovered from a variant analysis of [GHSA-cvpc-8phh-8f45](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-cvpc-8phh-8f45).", "methods": ["None"]}
