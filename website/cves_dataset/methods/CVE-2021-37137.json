{"description": "### Impact\nThe Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length which may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may buffer reserved skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received which may lead to excessive memory usage as well.\n\nThis vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a very big size (via a network stream or a file) or by sending a huge skippable chunk.\n\n### Impact\n\nAll users of SnappyFrameDecoder are affected and so the application may be in risk for a DoS attach due excessive memory usage.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.1.67.Final/codec/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/compression/SnappyFrameDecoder.java#L79\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.1.67.Final/codec/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/compression/SnappyFrameDecoder.java#L171\nhttps://github.com/netty/netty/blob/netty-4.1.67.Final/codec/src/main/java/io/netty/handler/codec/compression/SnappyFrameDecoder.java#L185", "methods": ["May cause excessive memory usage via network stream or file.", "May buffer reserved skippable chunks until whole chunk is received.", "May lead to DoS attack due to excessive memory usage."]}
