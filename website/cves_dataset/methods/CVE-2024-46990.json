{"description": "### Impact\nIf you're relying on blocking access to localhost using the default `0.0.0.0` filter this can be bypassed using other registered loopback devices (like `127.0.0.2` - `127.127.127.127`)\n\n### Workaround\nYou can block this bypass by manually adding the `127.0.0.0/8` CIDR range which will block access to any `127.X.X.X` ip instead of just `127.0.0.1`.\n\n", "methods": ["Bypassed loopback IP filter using registered loopback devices.", "Bypassed access control by using a different IP address (127.0.0.2 - 127.127.127.127).", "Blocked access to localhost using a CIDR range (127.0.0.0/8)."]}
