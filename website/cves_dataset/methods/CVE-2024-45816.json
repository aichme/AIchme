{"description": "### Impact\n\nWhen using the AWS S3 or GCS storage provider for TechDocs it is possible to access content in the entire storage bucket. This can leak contents of the bucket that are not intended to be accessible, as well as bypass permission checks in Backstage.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in the 1.10.13 release of the `@backstage/plugin-techdocs-backend` package.\n\n### References\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nOpen an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\nVisit our Discord, linked to in [Backstage README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\n", "methods": ["Used Directory Traversal to access content in the entire storage bucket.", "Bypassed permission checks."]}
