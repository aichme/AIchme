According to the maintainer, the bug only affects the client side of the request and cannot cause a denial of service on the server.\n\n## Original Description\nAn out-of-bounds read in the rewrite function at /modules/caddyhttp/rewrite/rewrite.go in Caddy v2.5.1 allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the client side via a crafted URI.", "methods": ["None of the techniques are applicable as this is a client-side DoS vulnerability, not an exploit."]}
