{"description": "All versions of `umount ` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize input rules and passes it directly to an `exec` call on the `umount` function . This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code in the system if the `device` value passed to the function is user-controlled.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.", "methods": ["Command Injection via unsanitized input rules passed to an exec call.", "Execution of arbitrary code in the system."]}
