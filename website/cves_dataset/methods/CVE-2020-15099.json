This includes the possibility to fetch _typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php_ which again contains the _encryptionKey_ as well as credentials of the database management system being used.\n\nIn case a database server is directly accessible either via internet or in a shared hosting network, this allows to completely retrieve, manipulate or delete database contents. This includes creating an administration user account - which can be used to trigger remote code execution by injecting custom extensions.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.20 or 10.4.6 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who reported and fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2020-007)", "methods": ["Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor through HMAC-SHA1.", "Retrieval of arbitrary files, including LocalConfiguration.php and database credentials.", "Manipulation or deletion of database contents.", "Creation of an administration user account for remote code execution.", "Injection of custom extensions for remote code execution."]}
