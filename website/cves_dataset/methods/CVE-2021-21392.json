{"description": "### Impact\nRequests to user provided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses when transitional IPv6 addresses were used. Outbound requests to federation, identity servers, when calculating the key validity for third-party invite events, sending push notifications, and generating URL previews are affected. This could cause Synapse to make requests to internal infrastructure on dual-stack networks.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is fixed by #9240.\n\n### Workarounds\nOutbound requests to the following address ranges can be blocked by a firewall, if unused for internal communication between systems:\n\n* `::ffff/80`\n* `::0000/80` (note that this IP range is considered deprecated by the IETF)\n* `2002::/16` (note that this IP range is considered deprecated by the IETF)\n\n### References\n* [RFC3056](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3056)\n* [RFC4291](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291)", "methods": ["Used transitional IPv6 addresses on dual-stack networks for open redirect.", "Made requests to internal infrastructure on dual-stack networks.", "Failed to restrict requests to external IP addresses.", "Used federation, identity servers, and push notifications for malicious purposes.", "Generated URL previews for malicious purposes."]}
