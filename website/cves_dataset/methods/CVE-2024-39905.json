{"description": "### Impact\n\nDue to a bug in Red's Core API, 3rd-party cogs using the [`@commands.can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.can_manage_channel) command permission check without additional permission controls may authorize a user to run a command even when that user doesn't have permissions to manage a channel.\nNone of the core commands or core cogs are affected. The maintainers of the project are not aware of any _public_ 3rd-party cog utilizing this API at the time of writing this advisory.\n\nThe [`@commands.mod_or_can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.mod_or_can_manage_channel), [`@commands.admin_or_can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.admin_or_can_manage_channel), and [`@commands.guildowner_or_can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.guildowner_or_can_manage_channel) command permission checks are unaffected.\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\nCVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:L/VA:N/SC:N/SI:L/SA:N/AU:Y/R:U/RE:L\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem was patched in PR #6398 and later released in version [3.5.10](https://pypi.org/project/Red-DiscordBot/3.5.10/).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAny cog using the [`@commands.can_manage_channel()`](https://docs.discord.red/en/stable/framework_checks.html#redbot.core.commands.can_manage_channel) command permission check should be unloaded until an upgrade to a patched version can be performed.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/pull/6398\nhttps://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/releases/tag/3.5.10\nhttps://pypi.org/project/Red-DiscordBot/3.5.10/\n\n", "methods": ["None of the techniques are mentioned in the description."]}
