{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe attacker can use the incorrect `Content-Type` to bypass the `Pre-Flight` checking of `fetch`. `fetch()` requests with Content-Type\u2019s [essence](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#mime-type-essence) as \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\", \"multipart/form-data\", or \"text/plain\", could potentially be used to invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus bypassing any [CORS protection](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#simple-header), and therefore they could lead to a  Cross-Site Request Forgery attack.\n\n### Patches\nFor `4.x` users, please update to at least `4.10.2`\nFor `3.x` users, please update to at least `3.29.4`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nImplement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection using [`@fastify/csrf`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastify/csrf).\n\n### References\n\nCheck out the HackerOne report: https://hackerone.com/reports/1763832.\n\n### For more information\n\n[Fastify security policy](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/policy)\n", "methods": ["Bypasses Pre-Flight checking of fetch.", "Invokes routes with incorrect Content-Type.", "Bypasses CORS protection.", "Leads to Cross-Site Request Forgery attack."]}
