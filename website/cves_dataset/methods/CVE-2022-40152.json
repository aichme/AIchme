{"description": "Those using FasterXML/woodstox to seralize XML data may be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to crash by stackoverflow. This effect may support a denial of service attack.\n\nThis vulnerability is only relevant for users making use of the DTD parsing functionality.", "methods": ["Uses user-supplied input to cause a parser crash.", "Exploits a vulnerability in FasterXML/woodstox to cause a Denial of Service (DOS) attack.", "Targets DTD parsing functionality."]}
