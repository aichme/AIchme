{"description": "VecCopy::data is created as a Vec of u8 but can be used to store and retrieve elements of different types leading to misaligned access.\n\nThe issue was resolved in v0.5.0 by replacing data being stored by Vec<u8> with a custom managed pointer. Elements are now stored and retrieved using types with proper alignment corresponding to original types.", "methods": ["Used out-of-bounds read in dync.", "Used misaligned access to VecCopy::data."]}
