{"description": "Jenkins Nexus Platform Plugin 3.18.0-03 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.\n\nAdditionally, the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, so attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.\n\nAdditionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nNexus Platform Plugin 3.18.1-01 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.\n\nAdditionally, POST requests and Overall/Administer permission are required for the affected HTTP endpoints.", "methods": ["Used XXE attacks to extract secrets from the Jenkins controller.", "Used server-side request forgery (SSRF) to make requests to an attacker-specified URL.", "Used cross-site request forgery (CSRF) to send HTTP requests without user interaction.", "Failed to perform permission checks in form validation methods.", "Failed to configure XML parser to prevent XXE attacks.", "Used Overall/Read permission to send HTTP requests to an attacker-specified URL.", "Used Overall/Administer permission to access affected HTTP endpoints."]}
