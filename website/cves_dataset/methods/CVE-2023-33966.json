{"description": "### Impact\n\nOutbound HTTP requests made using the built-in \"node:http\" or \"node:https\" modules are incorrectly not checked against the network permission allow list (`--allow-net`). Dependencies relying on these built-in modules are subject to the vulnerability too.\n\nUsers of Deno versions prior to 1.34.0 are unaffected. Deno Deploy users are unaffected.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis problem has been patched in Deno v1.34.1 and all users are recommended to update to this version.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround is available for this issue.\n", "methods": ["Missing network permission check for built-in modules.", "Outbound HTTP requests made without permission check.", "Incorrectly configured network permission allow list."]}
