{"description": "# Overview\nSome end users of OpenFGA v1.5.0 or later are vulnerable to authorization bypass when calling Check or ListObjects APIs.\n\n# Am I Affected?\nYou are very likely affected if your model involves exclusion (e.g. `a but not b`) or intersection (e.g. `a and b`) and you have any cyclical relationships. If you are using these, please update as soon as possible.\n\n# Fix\nUpdate to v1.5.3\n\n# Backward Compatibility\nThis update is backward compatible.", "methods": ["Authorization bypass through Check or ListObjects APIs.", "Use of exclusion or intersection in models with cyclical relationships."]}
