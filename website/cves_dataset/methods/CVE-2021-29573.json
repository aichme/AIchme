{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` is vulnerable to a division by 0:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\ngrad = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32)\nargmax = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64)\nksize = [1, 1, 1, 1]\nstrides = [1, 1, 1, 1]\n\ntf.raw_ops.MaxPoolGradWithArgmax(\n  input=input, grad=grad, argmax=argmax, ksize=ksize, strides=strides,\n  padding='SAME', include_batch_in_index=False)\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/279bab6efa22752a2827621b7edb56a730233bd8/tensorflow/core/kernels/maxpooling_op.cc#L1033-L1034) fails to validate that the batch dimension of the tensor is non-zero, before dividing by this quantity.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [376c352a37ce5a68b721406dc7e77ac4b6cf483d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/376c352a37ce5a68b721406dc7e77ac4b6cf483d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Division by 0 in `MaxPoolGradWithArgmax` implementation.", "Fails to validate that the batch dimension of the tensor is non-zero before dividing by this quantity."]}
