{"description": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Send for ReadTicket<T> & WriteTicket<T>. This allows to send non-Send T to other threads. This can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads (as T of ReadTicket<T>/WriteTicket<T>). Such data races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior. The flaw was corrected in commit `a986a93` by adding T: Send bounds to Send impls of ReadTicket<T>/WriteTicket<T>.", "methods": ["Implemented Send for non-Send types in ReadTicket<T> and WriteTicket<T>.", "Created data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads.", "Caused memory corruption or undefined behavior due to data races."]}
