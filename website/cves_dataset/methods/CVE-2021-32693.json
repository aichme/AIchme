{"description": "Description\n-----------\n\nWhen an application defines multiple firewalls, the authenticated token delivered by one of the firewalls is available to all other firewalls. This can be abused when the application defines different providers for different parts of an application. In such a situation, a user authenticated on one part of the application is considered authenticated on the whole application.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nWe now ensure that the authenticated token is only available for the firewall that generates it.\n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/3084764ad82f29dbb025df19978b9cbc3ab34728) for branch 5.3.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nI would like to thank Bogdan, gndk, Pawe\u0142 Warcho\u0142, Warxcell, and Adrien Lamotte for reporting the issue and Wouter J for fixing the issue.\n", "methods": ["Authentication bypass via multiple firewalls.", "Authentication token sharing between firewalls."]}
