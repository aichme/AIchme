{"description": "A resource-permission flaw was found in the `tripleo-heat-templates` package where `ceph.client.openstack.keyring` is created as world-readable. A local attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph cluster pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume. This has been patched in versions [7.0.6](https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/commit/a18fd59077d97de83496c85c017b9d256a3eddd4) and [8.0.0](https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-heat-templates/commit/ce7b65f443d38a6627631f53cb22336338e97d30).", "methods": ["Used a resource-permission flaw to access sensitive data.", "Used a flaw in the `tripleo-heat-templates` package to read or modify data on Ceph cluster pools.", "Used a flaw to read or modify data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume."]}
