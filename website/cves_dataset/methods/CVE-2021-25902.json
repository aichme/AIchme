{"description": "Affected versions of this crate did not guard against panic within the user-provided function f (2nd parameter of fn map_array), and thus panic within f causes double drop of a single object.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in the 0.4.0 release by wrapping the object vulnerable to a double drop within ManuallyDrop<T>.", "methods": ["Used a double free vulnerability in the glsl-layout crate.", "Failed to properly handle a panic within a user-provided function.", "Used a double drop of a single object.", "Failed to guard against a double drop of a single object."]}
