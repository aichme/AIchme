{"description": "### Impact\n\nAuthenticated users, regardless of their privileges (_User_ or _Admin_), can leak the value of any configuration entry of the dotenv file, e.g. the application secret (`APP_KEY`) and various passwords (email, database, etc). \n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue was addressed by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and preventing the use of nested variables in the resulting dotenv configuration file.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nOnly allow trusted source IP addresses to access to the administration dashboard.\n\n### References\n\nFurther technical details are available at [https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you can contact:\n- The original reporters, by sending an email to vulnerability.research [at] sonarsource.com;\n- The maintainers, by opening an issue on this repository.\n", "methods": ["Leverages configuration injection to execute code.", "Allows unauthorized access to sensitive configuration entries.", "Uses nested variables in configuration files.", "Allows access to the administration dashboard from untrusted source IP addresses."]}
