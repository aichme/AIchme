{"description": "Scala 2.13.x before 2.13.9 has a Java deserialization chain in its JAR file. On its own, it cannot be exploited. There is only a risk in conjunction with LazyList object deserialization within an application. In such situations, it allows attackers to erase contents of arbitrary files, make network connections, or possibly run arbitrary code (specifically, Function0 functions) via a gadget chain.", "methods": ["Used Java deserialization to execute arbitrary code.", "Used Java deserialization to delete files.", "Used Java deserialization to make network connections.", "Used Java deserialization to run arbitrary code via a gadget chain."]}
