{"description": "A vulnerability in the Eclipse Vert.x toolkit causes a memory leak in TCP servers configured with TLS and SNI support. When processing an unknown SNI server name assigned the default certificate instead of a mapped certificate, the SSL context is erroneously cached in the server name map, leading to memory exhaustion. This flaw allows attackers to send TLS client hello messages with fake server names, triggering a JVM out-of-memory error.", "methods": ["Exploits a memory leak in TCP servers.", "Uses fake server names to trigger a JVM out-of-memory error.", "Exploits a vulnerability in the Eclipse Vert.x toolkit."]}
