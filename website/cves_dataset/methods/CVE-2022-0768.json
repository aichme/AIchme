{"description": "### Impact\nReleases prior to 3.0.2 are vulnerable to a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability that allows an attacker to send a request to an internal hostname.\n\n### Patches\n3.0.2 contains a fix for this vulnerability.\n(The 1.x and 2.x releases are not maintained anymore.)\n\nPart of the fix requires applying [a patch](https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/blob/148a171b240e7ceb076b9e198bef412de14ac55d/patches/youtube-dl-redirect.diff) to youtube-dl to prevent it from following HTTP redirects. If you are using the version of youtube-dl bundled with 3.0.2, it is already patched.\nHowever, if you are using your own unpatched version of youtube-dl **you might still be vulnerable**.\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/commit/3a4f09dda0a466662a4e52cde674749e0c668e8d\n* https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/commit/1b099bb9836a3ce7c427a41722a7ab5a3d1c1b2d\n* https://huntr.dev/bounties/9b14cc46-ec08-4940-83cc-9f986b2a5903/\n* https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0768\n* https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/issues/30691", "methods": ["None of the techniques are mentioned in the description."]}
