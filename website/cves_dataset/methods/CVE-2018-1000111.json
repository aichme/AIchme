{"description": "An improper authorization vulnerability exists in Jenkins Subversion Plugin version 2.10.2 and earlier in `SubversionStatus.java` and `SubversionRepositoryStatus.java` that allows an attacker with network access to obtain a list of nodes and users. As of version 2.10.3, the class handling requests to /subversion/ no longer extends the class handling requests to the \u2026/search/ sub-path, therefore any such requests will fail.", "methods": ["Used an improper authorization vulnerability in Jenkins Subversion Plugin.", "Exploited a vulnerability in SubversionStatus.java and SubversionRepositoryStatus.java.", "Obtained a list of nodes and users through network access.", "Failed to obtain information due to a change in class handling requests."]}
