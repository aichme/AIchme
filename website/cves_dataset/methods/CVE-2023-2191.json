{"description": "AzuraCast/AzuraCast prior to version 0.18.0 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting. An issue was identified where a user who already had an AzuraCast account could update their display name to inject malicious JavaScript into the header menu of the site. In a majority of cases, this menu is only visible to the current logged-in user (pages like the `Administer Users` page are unaffected by this vulnerability), but if a higher-privileged administrator uses the `Log In As` feature to masquerade as a user, then the JavaScript injection could exfiltrate certain data. Anonymous members of the public cannot exploit this vulnerability in an AzuraCast installation, so it is primarily of concern for multi-tenant installations (i.e. resellers).", "methods": ["Injects malicious JavaScript into the header menu of the site.", "Exfiltrates data via JavaScript injection.", "Uses the \"Log In As\" feature to masquerade as a user."]}
