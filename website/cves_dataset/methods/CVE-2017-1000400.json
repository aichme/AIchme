{"description": "The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier remote API at /job/(job-name)/api contained information about upstream and downstream projects. This included information about tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API now only lists upstream and downstream projects that the current user has access to.", "methods": ["Missing Authorization in Jenkins API.", "Information Disclosure of sensitive project information.", "Lack of Item/Read permission."]}
