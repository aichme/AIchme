{"description": "### Impact\nA malicious homeserver could redirect requests to their .well-known file to a large file. This can lead to a denial of service attack where homeservers will consume significantly more resources when requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver.\n\nThis affects any server which accepts federation requests from untrusted servers.\n\n### Patches\nIssue is resolved by #8950. A bug not affecting the security aspects of this was fixed in #9108.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe `federation_domain_whitelist` setting can be used to restrict the homeservers communicated with over federation.", "methods": ["Redirects federation requests to a large file to cause a denial of service attack.", "Consumes significantly more resources on homeservers requesting the .well-known file of a malicious homeserver.", "Uses the .well-known file to redirect requests.", "Accepts federation requests from untrusted servers."]}
