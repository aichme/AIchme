{"description": "### Impact\nThe TFLite code for allocating `TFLiteIntArray`s is [vulnerable to an integer overflow issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L24-L27):\n\n```cc\nint TfLiteIntArrayGetSizeInBytes(int size) {\n  static TfLiteIntArray dummy;\n  return sizeof(dummy) + sizeof(dummy.data[0]) * size;\n}   \n```\n\nAn attacker can craft a model such that the `size` multiplier is so large that the return value overflows the `int` datatype and becomes negative. In turn, this results in [invalid value being given to `malloc`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/4ceffae632721e52bf3501b736e4fe9d1221cdfa/tensorflow/lite/c/common.c#L47-L52):\n\n```cc\nTfLiteIntArray* TfLiteIntArrayCreate(int size) {\n  TfLiteIntArray* ret = (TfLiteIntArray*)malloc(TfLiteIntArrayGetSizeInBytes(size));\n  ret->size = size; \n  return ret;\n}\n``` \n\nIn this case, `ret->size` would dereference an invalid pointer.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [7c8cc4ec69cd348e44ad6a2699057ca88faad3e5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7c8cc4ec69cd348e44ad6a2699057ca88faad3e5).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["None of the techniques are mentioned in the description."]}
