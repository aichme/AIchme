If markdown files with malicious HTML are converted to PDF, the resulting PDF file will execute any JavaScript code in the original markdown file. This may allow attackers to execute Remote Code.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 9.0.0 or later.", "methods": ["Uses a vulnerability in markdown-pdf to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.", "Executes arbitrary code remotely."]}
