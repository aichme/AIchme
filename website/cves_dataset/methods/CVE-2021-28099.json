{"description": "> ID: NFLX-2021-001\n> Title: Local information disclosure in Hollow\n> Release Date: 2021-03-23\n> Credit: Security Researcher @JLLeitschuh\n\n# Overview\n\nSecurity researcher @JLLeitschuh reported that Netflix Hollow (a Netflix OSS project available here: https://github.com/Netflix/hollow) writes to a local temporary directory before validating the permissions on it.\n\n# Impact\n\nAn attacker with the ability to create directories and set permissions on the local filesystem could pre-create this directory and read or modify anything written there by the Hollow process.\n\n# Description\n\nSince the `Files.exists(parent)` is run before creating the directories, an attacker can pre-create these directories with wide permissions. Additionally, since an insecure source of randomness is used, the file names to be created can be deterministically calculated.\n\n# Workarounds and Fixes\n\nAvoid running Hollow in configurations that share a filesystem with less-trusted processes. May be fixed in a future release.", "methods": ["Created directories with wide permissions to read or modify files written by the Hollow process.", "Deterministically calculated file names to be created.", "Used an insecure source of randomness."]}
