{"description": "The package is an Express middleware that normalises routes by stripping any final slash, redirecting, for example, `bookings/latest/` to `bookings/latest`. However, it does not validate the path it redirects to in any way. In particular, if the path starts with two slashes (or two backslashes, or a slash and a backslash, etc.) it may redirect to a different domain.\n\nConsider the [example from the docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slashify#usage). Assume we have run it and started a server on `localhost:3000`, then visiting `localhost:3000///github.com/` redirects you to https://github.com.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThis vulnerability is currently un-patched in the `slashify` package so there is no known safe version of this package. Discontinuing use of `slashify` is recommended.", "methods": ["Used an open redirect to redirect to a different domain.", "Failed to validate the path before redirecting."]}
