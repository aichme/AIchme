{"description": "### Impact\nWhen running with XLA, `tf.raw_ops.Bincount` segfaults when given a parameter `weights` that is neither the same shape as parameter `arr` nor a length-0 tensor.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nfunc = tf.raw_ops.Bincount\npara={'arr': 6, 'size': 804, 'weights': [52, 351]}\n\n@tf.function(jit_compile=True)\ndef fuzz_jit():\n y = func(**para)\n return y\n\nprint(fuzz_jit())\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8ae76cf085f4be26295d2ecf2081e759e04b8acf](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8ae76cf085f4be26295d2ecf2081e759e04b8acf).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by r3pwnx of 360 AIVul Team\n", "methods": ["None"]}
