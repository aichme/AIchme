{"description": "As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the permissions of temporary files it created so that only the current user was allowed to access them. Unfortunately the fixcrlf task deleted the temporary file and created a new one without said protection, effectively nullifying the effort. This would still allow an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.", "methods": ["Modified source files to inject malicious code into the build process.", "Deleted temporary files to create new ones without security protections.", "Created temporary files with insecure permissions."]}
