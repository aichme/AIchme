{"description": "### Impact\n\nUsers of JupyterLab with JupyterHub who have multiple JupyterLab tabs open in the same browser session, may see incomplete logout from the single-user server, as fresh credentials (for the single-user server only, not the Hub) reinstated after logout, if another active JupyterLab session is open while the logout takes place.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpgrade to JupyterHub 1.5. For distributed deployments, it is jupyterhub in the _user_ environment that needs patching. There are no patches necessary in the Hub environment.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only workaround is to make sure that only one JupyterLab tab is open when you log out.", "methods": ["Used JupyterLab with multiple tabs open in the same browser session.", "Incomplete logout from JupyterLab with simultaneous sessions.", "Fresh credentials reinstated after logout if another active JupyterLab session is open.", "Upgrade to JupyterHub 1.5 to patch the vulnerability.", "Patching required in the user environment, not the Hub environment.", "Only one JupyterLab tab should be open when logging out as a workaround."]}
