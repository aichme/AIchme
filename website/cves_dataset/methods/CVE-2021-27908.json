{"description": "### Impact\nSymfony parameters (which is what Mautic transforms configuration parameters into) can be used within other Symfony parameters by design. However, this also means that an admin who is normally not privy to certain parameters, such as database credentials, could expose them by leveraging any of the free text fields in Mautic\u2019s configuration that are used in publicly facing parts of the application.\n\nFor example,\n\n1. Go to Configuration page -> Landing Page Settings -> Analytics script and enter this: <`script> console.log(\"db password is: %mautic.db_password%\"); </script>`\n2. Visit any landing page and open the JS dev console. You will see the following message with real instance db password: `db password is: <real password>`\n\nRisk rating: ModerateCVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to 3.3.2\n\n### Workarounds\nNo\n\n### References\nNo\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Email us at [security@mautic.org](mailto:security@mautic.org)", "methods": ["Leverages free text fields in Mautic's configuration to expose sensitive information.", "Uses publicly facing parts of the application to expose sensitive information.", "Exposes sensitive information through the JavaScript console."]}
