{"description": "Jenkins applies formatting to the console output of builds, transforming plain URLs into hyperlinks. Jenkins 2.415 and earlier, 2.414 and earlier, and LTS 2.401.2 and earlier does not sanitize or properly encode URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control build log contents. Jenkins 2.416, 2.414.1, and LTS 2.401.3 encodes URLs of affected hyperlink annotations in build logs.\n", "methods": ["Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Jenkins build logs.", "Jenkins does not sanitize or properly encode URLs in build logs.", "Jenkins 2.415 and earlier, 2.414 and earlier, and LTS 2.401.2 and earlier are vulnerable.", "Jenkins 2.416, 2.414.1, and LTS 2.401.3 encode URLs of affected hyperlink annotations in build logs."]}
