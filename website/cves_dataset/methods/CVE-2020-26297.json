It's possible to install mdBook 0.4.5 on the local system with:\n\n```\ncargo install mdbook --version 0.4.5 --force\n```\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Kamil Vavra for responsibly disclosing the vulnerability to us according to [our security policy](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security).\n\n## Timeline of events\n\nAll times are listed in UTC.\n\n- 2020-12-30 20:14 - The issue is reported to the Rust Security Response WG\n- 2020-12-30 20:32 - The issue is acknowledged and the investigation began\n- 2020-12-30 21:21 - Found the cause of the vulnerability and prepared the patch\n- 2021-01-04 15:00 - Patched version released and vulnerability disclosed", "methods": ["Used cross-site scripting (XSS) to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the page.", "Tricked users into typing a malicious search query.", "Tricked users into clicking a link to the search page with a malicious search query prefilled."]}
