{"description": "IPython provides an interactive Python shell and Jupyter kernel to use Python interactively. Versions prior to 8.10.0 are vulnerable to command injection in the `set_term_title` [function](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/3f0bf05f072a91b2a3042d23ce250e5e906183fd/IPython/utils/terminal.py#L103-L117) under specific conditions. This has been patched in version 8.10.0.\n\n### Impact \nUsers are only vulnerable when calling this function in Windows in a Python environment where [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html) is not available. The dependency on ctypes in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable code from ever being reached (making it effectively dead code). However, as a library that could be used by another tool, `set_term_title` could introduce a vulnerability for dependencies. Currently `set_term_title` is only called with (semi-)trusted input that contain the current working directory of the current IPython session. If an attacker can control directory names, and manage to get a user to `cd` into this directory, then the attacker can execute arbitrary commands contained in the folder names.", "methods": ["Command injection via the `set_term_title` function in IPython versions prior to 8.10.0.", "Execution of arbitrary commands via directory names in the current working directory.", "Use of trusted input to execute malicious commands."]}
