{"description": "### Impact\nWhen the [`BaseCandidateSamplerOp`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/candidate_sampler_ops.cc) function  receives a value in `true_classes` larger than `range_max`, a heap oob vuln occurs.\n```python\ntf.raw_ops.ThreadUnsafeUnigramCandidateSampler(\n    true_classes=[[0x100000,1]],\n    num_true = 2,\n    num_sampled = 2,\n    unique = False,\n    range_max = 2,\n    seed = 2,\n    seed2 = 2)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b389f5c944cadfdfe599b3f1e4026e036f30d2d4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b389f5c944cadfdfe599b3f1e4026e036f30d2d4).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.\n", "methods": ["Heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `BaseCandidateSamplerOp` function.", "Use of a GitHub commit to patch the vulnerability.", "Cherrypicking the patch in multiple versions of TensorFlow (2.10.1, 2.9.3, 2.8.4).", "Use of a security guide for more information on the security model and contacting the team."]}
