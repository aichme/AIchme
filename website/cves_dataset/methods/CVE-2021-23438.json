{"description": "This affects the package mpath before 0.8.4. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2018-16490. In particular, the condition `ignoreProperties.indexOf(parts[i]) !== -1` returns `-1` if `parts[i]` is `['__proto__']`. This is because the method that has been called if the input is an array is `Array.prototype.indexOf()` and not `String.prototype.indexOf()`. They behave differently depending on the type of the input.", "methods": ["Exploited a type confusion vulnerability in the mpath package.", "Bypassed CVE-2018-16490.", "Used a condition to check for the presence of a specific string in an array.", "Leveraged the difference in behavior between Array.prototype.indexOf() and String.prototype.indexOf()."]}
