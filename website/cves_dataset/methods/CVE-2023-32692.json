{"description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code when you use Validation Placeholders.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the Validation library, and validation methods in the controller and in-model validation are also vulnerable because they use the Validation library internally.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to v4.3.5 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nSetting validation rules with an array.\n\nE.g.:\n```php\n$validation->setRules([\n    'email' => ['required', 'valid_email, 'is_unique[users.email,id,{id}]'],\n]);\n```\n\n### References\n- https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/validation.html#validation-placeholders\n- https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/incoming/controllers.html#validating-data\n- https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/models/model.html#in-model-validation\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues)\n* Email us at [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/SECURITY.md)\n", "methods": ["None of the techniques are mentioned in the description."]}
