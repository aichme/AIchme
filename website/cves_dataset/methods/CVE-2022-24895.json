{"description": "Description\n-----------\n\nWhen authenticating users Symfony by default regenerates the session ID upon login, but preserves the rest of session attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon login, this might enables [same-site attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism by performing an attack similar to a session-fixation.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nSymfony removes all CSRF tokens from the session on successful login.\n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/5909d74ecee359ea4982fcf4331aaf2e489a1fd4) for branch 4.4.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nWe would like to thank Marco Squarcina for reporting the issue and Nicolas Grekas for fixing it.", "methods": ["Uses session fixation to bypass CSRF protection.", "Preserves session attributes upon login.", "Fails to clear CSRF tokens upon login.", "Uses same-site attacks to bypass CSRF protection."]}
