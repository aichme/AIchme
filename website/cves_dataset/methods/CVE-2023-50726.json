{"description": "### Impact\n\n\"Local sync\" is an Argo CD feature that allows developers to temporarily override an Application's manifests with locally-defined manifests. Use of the feature should generally be limited to highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge protections in git.\n\nAn improper validation bug allows users who have `create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which is _not_ enforced is that the manifests come from some approved git/Helm/OCI source.\n\nThe bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the local manifest sync feature was added.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe bug has been patched in the following versions:\n\n* 2.10.3\n* 2.9.8\n* 2.8.12\n\n### Workarounds\n\nTo immediately mitigate the risk of branch protection bypass, remove `applications, create` RBAC access. The only way to eliminate the issue without removing RBAC access is to upgrade to a patched version.\n\nBranch protection rules and review requirements are a great way to enforce security constraints in a GitOps environment, but they should be just one layer in a multi-layered approach. Make sure your AppProject and RBAC restrictions are as thorough as possible to prevent a review bypass vulnerability from permitting excessive damage.\n\n### References\n\n* [Argo CD RBAC documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/rbac/)\n\n### For more information\n\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd", "methods": ["Bypass of security controls by exploiting a bug in the \"Local sync\" feature of Argo CD.", "Use of improper validation to gain unauthorized access to features.", "Bypass of branch protection rules and review requirements.", "Excessive privilege escalation by users with \"create\" but not \"override\" privileges."]}
