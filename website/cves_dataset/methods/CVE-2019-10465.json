This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to send an HTTP HEAD request to a user-specified URL, or confirm the existence of any file or directory on the Jenkins controller.\n\nAdditionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Used a missing permission check in the JenkinsDeploy WebLogic Plugin.", "Exploited a CSRF vulnerability in the form validation method.", "Sent an HTTP HEAD request to a user-specified URL.", "Confirmed the existence of any file or directory on the Jenkins controller."]}
