{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can send an invalid `Content-Type` header that can cause the application to crash, leading to a possible Denial of Service attack. Only the v4.x line is affected.\n\n(This was updated: upon a close inspection, v3.x is not affected after all).\n\n### Patches\nYes, update to `> v4.8.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can reject the malicious content types before the body parser enters in action.\n```js\n  const badNames = Object.getOwnPropertyNames({}.__proto__)\n  fastify.addHook('onRequest', async (req, reply) => {\n    for (const badName of badNames) {\n      if (req.headers['content-type'].indexOf(badName) > -1) {\n        reply.code(415)\n        throw new Error('Content type not supported')\n      }\n    }\n  })\n```\n\n### References\n\nSee the HackerOne report [#1715536](https://hackerone.com/bugs?report_id=1715536&subject=fastify)\n\n### For more information\n[Fastify security policy](https://github.com/fastify/fastify/security/policy)\n", "methods": ["Sent malicious HTTP requests with an invalid `Content-Type` header to cause a Denial of Service attack.", "Used a vulnerability in the `Content-Type` header to crash the application."]}
