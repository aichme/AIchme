{"description": "### Impact\nAny user who can edit any page like their profile can create a custom skin with a template override that is executed with programming right, thus allowing remote code execution. \n\nTo reproduce, as a user without edit, script or admin right, add an object of class `XWiki.XWikiSkins` to your profile. Name it whatever you want and set the Base Skin to `flamingo`.\nAdd an object of class `XWikiSkinFileOverrideClass` and set the path to `macros.vm` and the content to:\n```\n#macro(mediumUserAvatar $username)\n  #resizedUserAvatar($username 50)\n  $services.logging.getLogger('Skin').error(\"I got programming: $services.security.authorization.hasAccess('programming')\")\n#end\n```\nBack to your profile, click `Test this skin`. Force a refresh, just in case.\nIf the error \"Skin - I got programming: true\" gets logged, the installation is vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.4 and 15.10RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\nWe're not aware of any workaround except upgrading.\n\n### References\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21478\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/3d4dbb41f52d1a6e39835cfb1695ca6668605a39 (>= 15.8 RC1)\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/da177c3c972e797d92c1a31e278f946012c41b56 (< 15.8 RC1)\n", "methods": ["Created a custom skin with a template override to execute arbitrary code.", "Used a template override to inject malicious code in the `macros.vm` file.", "Executed arbitrary code with programming rights.", "Used a vulnerability in the XWiki Platform to gain remote code execution.", "Added an object of class `XWiki.XWikiSkins` to a user's profile to create a custom skin.", "Set the Base Skin to `flamingo` to enable the custom skin.", "Added an object of class `XWikiSkinFileOverrideClass` to override the `macros.vm` file.", "Injected malicious code in the `macros.vm` file to execute arbitrary code.", "Used the `services.logging.getLogger` and `services.security.authorization.hasAccess` methods to test for vulnerability."]}
