{"description": "### Summary\nGoogle Analytics element Attribute Injection leading to XSS\n\n### Details\nSince the custom status interface can set an independent Google Analytics ID and the template has not been sanitized, there is an attribute injection vulnerability here, which can lead to XSS attacks.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110759348/282278047-667b774b-421f-449a-8f95-3f3906ae4216.png)\n\n### PoC\n1. Run the latest version of the louislam/uptime-kuma container and initialize the account password.\n2. Create a new status page.\n3. Edit the status page and change the Google Analytics ID to following payload(it only works for firefox. Any attribute can be injected, but this seems the most intuitive):\n```\n123123\" onafterscriptexecute=alert(window.name+1),eval(window.name) a=\"x\n```\n\n4. Click Save and return to the interface. XSS occurs.\nscreenshots:\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110759348/282287393-4874974f-9416-4941-9c2e-a92ee2412197.png)\n\n![9d0603e634fb7da2e83a0a45dc0a36ac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110759348/282287346-1deb0382-520f-47cf-b191-9b7d19c47879.png)\n\n\n", "methods": ["Injected malicious code into a Google Analytics element.", "Used attribute injection to bypass sanitization.", "Executed malicious JavaScript code using the \"onafter\" attribute.", "Used the \"eval\" function to execute malicious code.", "Injected malicious code into a web page using a custom status interface.", "Used a payload to exploit a vulnerability in the interface."]}
