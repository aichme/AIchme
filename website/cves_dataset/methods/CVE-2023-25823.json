{"description": "### Impact\nThis is a vulnerability which affects anyone using Gradio's share links (i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`) with Gradio versions older than 3.13.1. In these older versions of Gradio, a private SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of access/exposure the Gradio app provides. \n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched. Ideally, users should upgrade to `gradio==3.19.1` or later where the FRP solution has been properly tested. \n\n### Credit\nCredit to Greg Sadetsky and Samuel Tremblay-Cossette for alerting the team", "methods": ["Used SSH tunneling for C2 infrastructure.", "Sent malicious files via email.", "Executed payloads using PowerShell commands.", "Used direct system calls via Dumpert.", "Used malicious DLLs for persistence in the Registry Key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current Version\\Run.", "Exposed private SSH keys for unauthorized access."]}
