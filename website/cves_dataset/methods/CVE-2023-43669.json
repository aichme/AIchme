{"description": "The Tungstenite crate through 0.20.0 for Rust allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (minutes of CPU consumption) via an excessive length of an HTTP header in a client handshake. The length affects both how many times a parse is attempted (e.g., thousands of times) and the average amount of data for each parse attempt (e.g., millions of bytes).", "methods": ["Causes a denial of service (minutes of CPU consumption) via an excessive length of an HTTP header in a client handshake.", "Causes a denial of service (thousands of parse attempts) via an excessive length of an HTTP header in a client handshake.", "Causes a denial of service (millions of bytes of data) via an excessive length of an HTTP header in a client handshake."]}
