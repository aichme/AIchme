{"description": "### Summary\n\nSeveral API endpoints can be accessed by users without correct authentication/authorization.\n\nThe main API endpoints affected by this:\n\n-   `/api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_certificate/`\n-   `/api/v3/crypto/certificatekeypairs/<uuid>/view_private_key/`\n-   `/api/v3/.../used_by/`\n\nNote that all of the affected API endpoints require the knowledge of the ID of an object, which especially for certificates is not accessible to an unprivileged user. Additionally the IDs for most objects are UUIDv4, meaning they are not easily guessable/enumerable.\n\n### Patches\n\nauthentik 2024.4.4, 2024.6.4 and 2024.8.0 fix this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAccess to the API endpoints can be blocked at a Reverse-proxy/Load balancer level to prevent this issue from being exploited.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n-   Email us at [security@goauthentik.io](mailto:security@goauthentik.io)\n", "methods": ["Lateral Movement: Access to API endpoints without correct authentication/authorization.", "Lateral Movement: Access to sensitive information (certificate keys) without correct authentication/authorization.", "Lateral Movement: Access to sensitive information (private keys) without correct authentication/authorization.", "Lateral Movement: Access to sensitive information (object IDs) without correct authentication/authorization.", "Defense Evasion: Use of UUIDv4 to make object IDs not easily guessable/enumerable.", "Defense Evasion: Use of UUIDv4 to make object IDs not easily guessable/enumerable.", "Defense Evasion: Blocking access to API endpoints at a Reverse-proxy/Load balancer level."]}
