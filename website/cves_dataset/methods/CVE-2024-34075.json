{"description": "### Summary\nAn unsafe sanitization of dataset contents on the `MarkovData#getNext` method used in `Markov#generate` and `Markov#choose` allows a maliciously crafted string on the dataset to throw and stop the function from running properly.\n\n### Details\nhttps://github.com/xiboon/kurwov/blob/0d58dfa42135ab40e830e92622857282f980ca89/src/MarkovData.ts#L38-L44\n\nIf a string contains a forbidden substring (i.e. `__proto__`) followed by a space character, the second line will access a special property in `MarkovData#finalData` by removing the last character of the string, bypassing the dataset sanitization (as it is supposed to be already sanitized before this function is called).\n\n`data` is then defined as the special function found in its prototype instead of an array.\n\nOn the last line, `data` is then indexed by a random number, which is supposed to return a string but returns undefined as it's a function. Calling `endsWith` then throws.\n\n### PoC\nhttps://runkit.com/embed/m6uu40r5ja9b\n\n### Impact\nAny dataset can be contaminated with the substring making it unable to properly generate anything in some cases.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the `MarkovData#getNext` method to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by passing a maliciously crafted string containing a forbidden substring (`__proto__`) followed by a space character.", "Exploited the lack of proper sanitization of dataset contents to bypass security controls and access a special property in `MarkovData#finalData`.", "Used a maliciously crafted string to remove the last character of the string, allowing access to a function in the prototype instead of an array.", "Used a function in the prototype as an array index, resulting in undefined being returned and causing the `endsWith` method to throw.", "Created a Proof of Concept (PoC) to demonstrate the vulnerability using a runkit."]}
