{"description": "Jenkins Docker Swarm Plugin processes Docker responses to generate the Docker Swarm Dashboard view.\n\nDocker Swarm Plugin 1.11 and earlier does not escape values returned from Docker before inserting them into the Docker Swarm Dashboard view. This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control responses from Docker.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Used a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Jenkins Docker Swarm Plugin.", "Failed to escape values returned from Docker."]}
