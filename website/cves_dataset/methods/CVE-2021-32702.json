{"description": "### Overview\n\nVersions before and including `1.4.1` are vulnerable to reflected XSS.  An attacker can execute arbitrary code by providing an XSS payload in the `error` query parameter which is then processed by the callback handler as an error message.\n\n### Am I affected?\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` version `1.4.1` or lower **unless** you are using custom error handling that does not return the error message in an HTML response.\n\n### How to fix that?\nUpgrade to version `1.4.2`.\n\n### Will this update impact my users?\nThe fix adds basic HTML escaping to the error message and it should not impact your users.\n\n### Credit\n\nhttps://github.com/inian\nhttps://github.com/git-ishanpatel", "methods": ["Used reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) to execute arbitrary code.", "Used a callback handler's error query parameter to inject malicious code."]}
