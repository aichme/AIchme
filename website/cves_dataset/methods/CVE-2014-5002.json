Passwords are only configured in a configuration file, so it's no longer possible to expose passwords on the command line.", "methods": ["Exposes database password to unauthorized users through unsanitized user input.", "Allows local users to obtain sensitive information by listing processes.", "Uses command line to expose passwords."]}
