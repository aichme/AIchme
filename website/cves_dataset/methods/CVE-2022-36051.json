{"description": "### Impact\n\n**Actions**, introduced in ZITADEL **1.42.0** on the API and **1.56.0** for Console, is a feature, where users with role `ORG_OWNER` are able to create Javascript Code, which is invoked by the system at certain points during the login.\n**Actions**, for example, allow creating authorizations (user grants) on newly created users programmatically.\nDue to a missing authorization check, **Actions** were able to grant authorizations for projects that belong to other organisations inside the same Instance. Granting authorizations via API and Console is not affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\n2.x versions are fixed on >= [2.2.0](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.2.0)\n1.x versions are fixed on >= [1.87.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v1.87.1)\n\nZITADEL recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround since a patch is already available.\n\n### Who did disclose this\n\nDuring our recurring white box penetration test our external security consultant found this issue.\nThe full report will be made public after the complete review.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://docs.zitadel.com/docs/guides/manage/customize/behavior\nhttps://docs.zitadel.com/docs/apis/actions\nhttps://zitadel.com/blog/pentest-results-h1-2021\n\n### Questions\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)\n", "methods": ["Missing authorization check in Actions feature.", "Ability to grant authorizations for projects outside the user's organization.", "Ability to create Javascript Code with elevated privileges.", "Ability to create authorizations programmatically.", "Ability to create user grants programmatically."]}
