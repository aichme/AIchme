{"description": "An issue was discovered in the array-tools crate before 0.3.2 for Rust. Affected versions of this crate don't guard against panics, so that partially uninitialized buffer is dropped when user-provided `T::clone()` panics in `FixedCapacityDequeLike<T, A>::clone()`. This causes memory corruption.\n", "methods": ["Causes memory corruption through buffer overflow.", "Exploits panic in user-provided code.", "Uses partially uninitialized buffer."]}
