{"description": "### Impact\nDeserialization of Untrusted Data was found in the `old()` function in CodeIgniter4.\nRemote attackers may inject auto-loadable arbitrary objects with this vulnerability, \nand possibly execute existing PHP code on the server.\nWe are aware of a working exploit, which can lead to SQL injection.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to v4.1.6 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not use:\n- `old()` and form_helper\n- `RedirectResponse::withInput()` and `redirect()->withInput()`\n\n### References\n- [PHP Object Injection | OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/PHP_Object_Injection)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues)\n* Email us at [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/SECURITY.md)\n", "methods": ["Deserialization of Untrusted Data in CodeIgniter4.", "Injecting auto-loadable arbitrary objects.", "Executing existing PHP code on the server.", "SQL injection via a working exploit.", "Using `old()` function in CodeIgniter4.", "Using `RedirectResponse::withInput()` and `redirect()->withInput()`.", "Using `old()` and form_helper."]}
