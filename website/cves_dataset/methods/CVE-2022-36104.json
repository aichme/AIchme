This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded.\n\nThis vulnerability is the same as described in [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-005](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-005) ([CVE-2021-21359](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21359)). A regression, introduced during TYPO3 v11 development, led to this situation.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 version 11.5.16 that fixes the problem described above.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Rik Willems who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-006](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-006)", "methods": ["Amplified Denial of Service (DoS) via recursive application calls.", "Triggering of page error handler via HTTP requests."]}
