{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in all binary cwise operations that don't require broadcasting (e.g., gradients of binary cwise operations):\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.SqrtGrad(y=[4, 16],dy=[])\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/cwise_ops_common.h#L264) assumes that the two inputs have exactly the same number of elements but does not check that. Hence, when the eigen functor executes it triggers heap OOB reads and undefined behavior due to binding to nullptr.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [93f428fd1768df147171ed674fee1fc5ab8309ec](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/93f428fd1768df147171ed674fee1fc5ab8309ec).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n  \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution \nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo  360.", "methods": ["Reference binding to nullptr in binary cwise operations.", "Heap OOB reads due to binding to nullptr.", "Triggering undefined behavior."]}
