{"description": "Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, contains two authorization related vulnerabilities:\n\n- [CVE-2021-32777](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32779): incorrectly transform a URL containing a `#fragment` element, causing a mismatch in path-prefix based authorization decisions.\n- [CVE-2021-32779](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32777): incorrectly handle duplicate headers, dropping all but the last.  This may lead to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions.\n\n### Impact\nWith specially crafted requests, incorrect authorization or routing decisions may be made by Pomerium.\n\n### Patches\n\nPomerium v0.14.8 and v0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with these vulnerabilities patched.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- This issue can only be triggered when using path prefix based policy.  Removing any such policies should provide mitigation.\n\n\n### References\n[envoy GSA CVE-2021-32777](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-r222-74fw-jqr9)\n[envoy GSA CVE-2021-32779](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-6g4j-5vrw-2m8h)\n[envoy announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/envoy-announce/c/5xBpsEZZDfE/m/wD05NZBbAgAJ)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [pomerium/pomerium](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/issues)\n* Email us at [security@pomerium.com](mailto:security@pomerium.com)\n", "methods": ["Incorrectly transforms a URL containing a `#fragment` element, causing a mismatch in path-prefix based authorization decisions.", "Incorrectly handles duplicate headers, dropping all but the last, leading to incorrect routing or authorization policy decisions.", "Triggers incorrect authorization or routing decisions with specially crafted requests.", "Uses path prefix based policy to trigger the issue."]}
