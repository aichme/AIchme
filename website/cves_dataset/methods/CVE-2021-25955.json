{"description": "In `Dolibarr ERP CRM`, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged application users to store malicious scripts in the `Private Note` field at `/adherents/note.php?id=1` endpoint. These scripts are executed in a victim\u2019s browser when they open the page containing the vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private notes which could lead to privilege escalation.", "methods": ["Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WYSIWYG Editor module.", "Injected malicious scripts in the Private Note field at /adherents/note.php?id=1 endpoint.", "Extracted Session ID from victim's browser.", "Privilege escalation through Improper Access Control on Private notes.", "Stored malicious scripts in a victim's browser."]}
