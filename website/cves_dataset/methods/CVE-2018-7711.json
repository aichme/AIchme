{"description": "HTTPRedirect.php in the saml2 library in SimpleSAMLphp before 1.15.4 has an incorrect check of return values in the signature validation utilities, allowing an attacker to get invalid signatures accepted as valid by forcing an error during validation. This occurs because of a dependency on PHP functionality that interprets a -1 error code as a true boolean value.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the SimpleSAMLphp saml2 library to bypass signature validation.", "Exploited incorrect PHP functionality to interpret a -1 error code as a true boolean value."]}
