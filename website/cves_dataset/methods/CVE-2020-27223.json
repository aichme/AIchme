{"description": "### Impact\nWhen Jetty handles a request containing request headers with a large number of \u201cquality\u201d (i.e. q) parameters (such as what are seen on the `Accept`, `Accept-Encoding`, and `Accept-Language` request headers), the server may enter a denial of service (DoS) state due to high CPU usage while sorting the list of values based on their quality values.  A single request can easily consume minutes of CPU time before it is even dispatched to the application.\n\nThe only features within Jetty that can trigger this behavior are:\n\n- Default Error Handling - the `Accept` request header with the `QuotedQualityCSV` is used to determine what kind of content to send back to the client (html, text, json, xml, etc)\n- `StatisticsServlet` - uses the `Accept` request header with the `QuotedQualityCSV` to determine what kind of content to send back to the client (xml, json, text, html, etc)\n- `HttpServletRequest.getLocale()` - uses the `Accept-Language` request header with the `QuotedQualityCSV` to determine which \u201cpreferred\u201d language is returned on this call.\n- `HttpservletRequest.getLocales()` - is similar to the above, but returns an ordered list of locales based on the quality values on the `Accept-Language` request header.\n- `DefaultServlet` - uses the `Accept-Encoding` request header with the `QuotedQualityCSV` to determine which kind of pre-compressed content should be sent back for static content (content that is not matched against a url-pattern in your web app)\n\n### Versions\n`QuotedQualityCSV` was introduced to Jetty 9.3.9.v20160517 and the bug that introduced the vulnerability was in 9.4.6.v20170531. \n\nCurrently, known vulnerable versions include:\n\n- 9.4.6.v20170531 thru to 9.4.36.v20210114\n- 10.0.0\n- 11.0.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nQuality ordered values are used infrequently by jetty so they can be avoided by:\n\n * Do not use the default error page/handler.\n * Do not deploy the `StatisticsServlet` exposed to the network\n * Do not call `getLocale` API\n * Do not enable precompressed static content in the `DefaultServlet` \n\n### Patches\n\nAll patches are available for download from the Eclipse Jetty website at [https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.php](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/download.php)\n- 9.4.37.v20210219 and greater\n- 10.0.1 and greater \n- 11.0.1 and greater", "methods": ["Used a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in Jetty's handling of Quoted Quality CSV headers.", "Exploited the \"Default Error Handling\" feature to trigger the DoS.", "Exploited the \"StatisticsServlet\" feature to trigger the DoS.", "Exploited the \"HttpServletRequest.getLocale()\" method to trigger the DoS.", "Exploited the \"HttpServletRequest.getLocales()\" method to trigger the DoS.", "Exploited the \"DefaultServlet\" feature to trigger the DoS.", "Exploited the \"QuotedQualityCSV\" feature to trigger the DoS.", "Exploited vulnerable versions of Jetty, including 9.4.6.v20170531 to 9.4.36.v20210114, 10.0.0, and 11.0.0."]}
