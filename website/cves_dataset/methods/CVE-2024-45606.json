{"description": "### Impact\nAn authenticated user can mute alert rules from arbitrary organizations and projects given a known given rule ID. The user does not need to be a member of the organization or have permissions on the project. \n\nIn our review, we have identified no instances where alerts have been muted by unauthorized parties. \n\n### Patches\nA patch was issued to ensure authorization checks are properly scoped on requests to mute alert rules. Authenticated users who do not have the necessary permissions are no longer able to mute alerts. \n\nSentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. [Self-Hosted Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted) users should upgrade to version **24.9.0** or higher.\n\n### Affected Versions\nThe rule mute feature was generally available as of 23.6.0 but users with early access may have had the feature as of 23.4.0. \n\n### References\n- [Prevent muting alerts](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/77016)\n", "methods": ["An authenticated user can mute alert rules from arbitrary organizations and projects given a known rule ID.", "Authenticated users who do not have necessary permissions can mute alerts.", "Authorization checks are not properly scoped on requests to mute alert rules.", "Users with early access may have had the feature to mute alerts as of 23.4.0."]}
