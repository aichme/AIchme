When new URL() throws an error, it can be manipulated to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit this weakness to redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially leading to information disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security breaches.", "methods": ["Manipulated URLs to redirect traffic to a malicious site.", "Exploited Improper Input Validation.", "Conducted information disclosure.", "Conducted phishing attacks."]}
