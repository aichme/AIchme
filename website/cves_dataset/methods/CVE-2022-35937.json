{"description": "### Impact\nThe [`GatherNd`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f463040eb3997e42e60a2ffc6dc72de7ef11dbb4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/gather_nd.cc#L105-L111) function takes arguments that determine the sizes of inputs and outputs. If the inputs given are greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs, an out-of-bounds memory read is triggered.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [595a65a3e224a0362d7e68c2213acfc2b499a196](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/595a65a3e224a0362d7e68c2213acfc2b499a196).\n\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Hui Peng from Baidu Security.\n", "methods": ["Used out-of-bounds read in `GatherNd` function in TensorFlow Lite.", "Triggered by inputs greater than or equal to the sizes of the outputs."]}
