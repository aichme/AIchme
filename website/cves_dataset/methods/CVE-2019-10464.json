{"description": "JenkinsDeploy WebLogic Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to send an HTTP HEAD request to a user-specified URL, or confirm the existence of any file or directory on the Jenkins controller.\n\nAdditionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Used a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability to send an HTTP HEAD request to a user-specified URL.", "Used a CSRF vulnerability to confirm the existence of any file or directory on the Jenkins controller.", "Used a vulnerability in the JenkinsDeploy WebLogic Plugin to bypass permission checks."]}
