{"description": "### Impact\n\nA specially crafted value of the `Sec-Websocket-Protocol` header can be used to significantly slow down a ws server.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\n```js\nfor (const length of [1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000]) {\n  const value = 'b' + ' '.repeat(length) + 'x';\n  const start = process.hrtime.bigint();\n\n  value.trim().split(/ *, */);\n\n  const end = process.hrtime.bigint();\n\n  console.log('length = %d, time = %f ns', length, end - start);\n}\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability was fixed in ws@7.4.6 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/00c425ec77993773d823f018f64a5c44e17023ff) and backported to ws@6.2.2 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/78c676d2a1acefbc05292e9f7ea0a9457704bf1b) and ws@5.2.3 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/76d47c1479002022a3e4357b3c9f0e23a68d4cd2).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated by reducing the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_max_http_header_size_size) and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener) options.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was responsibly disclosed along with a fix in private by [Robert McLaughlin](https://github.com/robmcl4) from University of California, Santa Barbara.\n", "methods": ["Used a denial of service (ReDoS) attack in the Sec-Websocket-Protocol header.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the ws library, specifically in versions prior to 7.4.6, 6.2.2, and 5.2.3.", "Used a proof of concept code to demonstrate the vulnerability.", "Provided a patch for the vulnerability in the ws library.", "Suggested workarounds to mitigate the issue, including reducing the maximum allowed length of request headers."]}
