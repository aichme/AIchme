{"description": "### Overview\nDuring our internal security assessment, it was discovered that OpenFGA versions `v0.2.3` and prior are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions.\n\n### Am I affected?\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if you are using `openfga/openfga` version `v0.2.3` and you added a tuple with a wildcard (*) assigned to a tupleset relation (the right hand side of a \u2018from\u2019 statement).\n\n### How to fix that?\nUpgrade to version `v0.2.4`.\n\n### Backward Compatibility\nThis update is not backward compatible with any authorization model that uses wildcard on a tupleset relation.\n\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in OpenFGA to bypass authorization.", "Exploited a version-specific vulnerability in OpenFGA (v0.2.3 and prior).", "Utilized a wildcard (*) in a tupleset relation to bypass authorization."]}
