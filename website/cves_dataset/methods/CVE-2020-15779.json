{"description": "All versions of `socket.io-file` are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The package fails to sanitize user input and uses it to generate the file upload paths. The `socket.io-file::createFile` message contains a `name` option that is passed directly to `path.join()`.   It is possible to upload files to arbitrary folders on the server by sending relative paths on the `name` value, such as `../../test.js`.  The `uploadDir` and `rename` options can be used to define the file upload path.", "methods": ["Used Path Traversal to upload files to arbitrary folders on the server.", "Failed to sanitize user input, allowing for arbitrary path injection.", "Used relative paths to bypass file upload restrictions.", "Manipulated the `name` value to control the file upload path.", "Utilized the `uploadDir` and `rename` options to define the file upload path."]}
