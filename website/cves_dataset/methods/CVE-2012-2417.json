{"description": "PyCrypto before 2.6 does not produce appropriate prime numbers when using an ElGamal scheme to generate a key, which reduces the signature space or public key space and makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force attacks to obtain the private key.", "methods": ["Uses a flawed cryptographic library to generate keys.", "Reduces signature or public key space.", "Enables brute force attacks to obtain private key."]}
