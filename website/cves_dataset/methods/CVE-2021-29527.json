{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger a division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput = tf.zeros([1, 1, 1, 1], dtype=tf.quint8)\nfilter = tf.constant([], shape=[1, 0, 1, 1], dtype=tf.quint8)\nmin_input = tf.constant(0.0)\nmax_input = tf.constant(0.0001)\nmin_filter = tf.constant(0.0)\nmax_filter = tf.constant(0.0001)\nstrides = [1, 1, 1, 1]\npadding = \"SAME\"               \n                               \n\ntf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D(input=input, filter=filter, min_input=min_input, max_input=max_input, min_filter=min_filter, max_filter=max_filter, strides=strides, padding=padding)\n```\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/00e9a4d67d76703fa1aee33dac582acf317e0e81/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_conv_ops.cc#L257-L259) does a division by a quantity that is controlled by the caller: \n\n```cc\nconst int filter_value_count = filter_width * filter_height * input_depth;\nconst int64 patches_per_chunk = kMaxChunkSize / (filter_value_count * sizeof(T1));\n```\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [cfa91be9863a91d5105a3b4941096044ab32036b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cfa91be9863a91d5105a3b4941096044ab32036b).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedConv2D` due to controlled division by a quantity set by the caller.", "Use of a division by a quantity controlled by the caller."]}
