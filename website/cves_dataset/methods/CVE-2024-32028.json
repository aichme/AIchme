{"description": "## Impact\n\n`OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` writes the `url.full` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for outgoing http requests and `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` writes the `url.query` attribute/tag on spans (`Activity`) when tracing is enabled for incoming http requests.\n\nThese attributes are defined by the [Semantic Conventions for HTTP Spans](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-spans.md).\n\nUp until the `1.8.1` the values written by `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will pass-through the raw query string as was sent or received (respectively). This may lead to sensitive information (e.g. EUII - End User Identifiable Information, credentials, etc.) being leaked into telemetry backends (depending on the application(s) being instrumented) which could cause privacy and/or security incidents.\n\nNote: Older versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` may use different tag names but have the same vulnerability.\n\n## Resolution\n\nThe `1.8.1` versions of `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.Http` & `OpenTelemetry.Instrumentation.AspNetCore` will now redact by default all values detected on transmitted or received query strings.\n\nExample transmitted or received query sting:\n\n`?key1=value1&key2=value2`\n\nExample of redacted value written on telemetry:\n\n`?key1=Redacted&key2=Redacted`", "methods": ["Leaks sensitive information through logging of query parameters.", "Leaks sensitive information through logging of user identifiable information.", "Leaks sensitive information through logging of credentials.", "Leaks sensitive information through logging of query strings.", "Leaks sensitive information through logging of HTTP requests.", "Leaks sensitive information through logging of incoming HTTP requests.", "Leaks sensitive information through logging of outgoing HTTP requests.", "Leaks sensitive information through logging of transmitted query strings.", "Leaks sensitive information through logging of received query strings."]}
