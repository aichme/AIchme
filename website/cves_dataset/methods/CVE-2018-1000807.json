{"description": "It was discovered that pyOpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when handling X509 objects. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause pyOpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This attack appears to be exploitable via Depends on the calling application and if it retains a reference to the memory. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 17.5.0.", "methods": ["Exploitation of a Use-After-Free vulnerability in pyOpenSSL.", "Denial of Service (DoS) attack.", "Execution of arbitrary code.", "Remote exploitation."]}
