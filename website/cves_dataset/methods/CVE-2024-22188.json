{"description": "### Problem\nSeveral settings in the Install Tool for configuring the path to system binaries were vulnerable to code execution. Exploiting this vulnerability requires an administrator-level backend user account with system maintainer permissions.\n\nThe corresponding change for this advisory involves enforcing the known disadvantages described in [TYPO3-PSA-2020-002: Protecting Install Tool with Sudo Mode](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-psa-2020-002).\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Rickmer Frier & Daniel Jonka who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2024-002](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2024-002)\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable configuration in the Install Tool for code execution.", "Exploited an administrator-level backend user account with system maintainer permissions.", "Used a path traversal vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.", "Used a configuration vulnerability to execute arbitrary code."]}
