{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can read data outside of bounds of heap allocated buffer in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV3`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV3(\n  input=[2.5,2.5], input_min=[0,0], input_max=[1,1], num_bits=[30],\n  signed_input=False, range_given=False, narrow_range=False, axis=3)\n```   \n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/11ff7f80667e6490d7b5174aa6bf5e01886e770f/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L237) does not validate the value of user supplied `axis` attribute before using it to index in the array backing the `input` argument:\n\n```cc\nconst int depth = (axis_ == -1) ? 1 : input.dim_size(axis_);\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [99085e8ff02c3763a0ec2263e44daec416f6a387](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/99085e8ff02c3763a0ec2263e44daec416f6a387).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB in `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3` due to lack of validation of user-supplied `axis` attribute.", "Use of user-supplied input to index into an array without bounds checking."]}
