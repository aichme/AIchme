{"description": "The Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper supports a method for short-circuit navigation state changes by prefixing parameters with \"action:\" or \"redirect:\", followed by a desired navigational target expression. This mechanism was intended to help with attaching navigational information to buttons within forms.\n\nIn Struts 2 before 2.3.15.1 the information following \"action:\", \"redirect:\" or \"redirectAction:\" is not properly sanitized. Since said information will be evaluated as OGNL expression against the value stack, this introduces the possibility to inject server side code.", "methods": ["Used OGNL expression injection to inject server-side code.", "Injected code through unsanitized input in the Struts 2 DefaultActionMapper."]}
