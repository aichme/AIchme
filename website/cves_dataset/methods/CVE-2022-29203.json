{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND` (in all backends such as XLA and handwritten kernels) is vulnerable to an integer overflow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput = tf.constant(-3.5e+35, shape=[10,19,22], dtype=tf.float32)\nblock_shape = tf.constant(-1879048192, shape=[2], dtype=tf.int64)\npaddings = tf.constant(0, shape=[2,2], dtype=tf.int32)\ntf.raw_ops.SpaceToBatchND(input=input, block_shape=block_shape, paddings=paddings)\n```\n\nThe result of this integer overflow is used to allocate the output tensor, hence we get a denial of service via a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure), as in [TFSA-2021-198](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-198.md).\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [acd56b8bcb72b163c834ae4f18469047b001fadf](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/acd56b8bcb72b163c834ae4f18469047b001fadf).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n  \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n  \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou from Secure Systems Lab at Brown University.\n", "methods": ["Integer overflow in `SpaceToBatchND` implementation.", "Denial of service via a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure).", "Patched in GitHub commit `acd56b8bcb72b163c834ae4f18469047b001fadf`.", "Patches included in TensorFlow 2.9.0, and backported to 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4."]}
