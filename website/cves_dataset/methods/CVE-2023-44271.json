{"description": "An issue was discovered in Pillow before 10.0.0. It is a Denial of Service that uncontrollably allocates memory to process a given task, potentially causing a service to crash by having it run out of memory. This occurs for truetype in ImageFont when textlength in an ImageDraw instance operates on a long text argument.", "methods": ["Uncontrolled resource consumption (memory) to cause a service to crash.", "Crash the service by running out of memory."]}
