Affected extensions must implement new `MimicServiceInterface::mimicAuthUser`, which simulates corresponding times regular processing would usually take.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 version 7.6.58 ELTS, 8.7.48 ELTS, 9.5.37 ELTS, 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem described above.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Vautia who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team members Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-007](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-007)\n* [Vulnerability Report on huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/7d519735-2877-4fad-bd77-accde3e290a7/) (embargoed +30 days)", "methods": ["User enumeration via response timing during authentication.", "Leveraging a custom authentication service to simulate regular processing times.", "Implementing a new interface (`MimicServiceInterface::mimicAuthUser`) to prevent user enumeration.", "Updating to a fixed TYPO3 version (7.6.58 ELTS, 8.7.48 ELTS, 9.5.37 ELTS, 10.4.32 or 11.5.16)."]}
