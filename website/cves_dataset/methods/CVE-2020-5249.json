{"description": "### Impact\nIf an application using Puma allows untrusted input in an early-hints header, an attacker can use a carriage return character to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as [HTTP Response Splitting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/HTTP_Response_Splitting).\n\nWhile not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).\n\nThis is related to [CVE-2020-5247](https://github.com/puma/puma/security/advisories/GHSA-84j7-475p-hp8v), which fixed this vulnerability but only for regular responses.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed in 4.3.3 and 3.12.4.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can not allow untrusted/user input in the Early Hints response header.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [puma](https://github.com/puma/puma)\n* Email us a project maintainer.
