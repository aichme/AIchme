{"description": "Waitress through version 1.3.1 allows request smuggling by sending the Content-Length header twice. Waitress would header fold a double Content-Length header and due to being unable to cast the now comma separated value to an integer would set the Content-Length to 0 internally. If two Content-Length headers are sent in a single request, Waitress would treat the request as having no body, thereby treating the body of the request as a new request in HTTP pipelining. This issue is fixed in Waitress 1.4.0.", "methods": ["Manipulated HTTP requests to smuggle content.", "Exploited inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests.", "Used HTTP pipelining to treat a request body as a new request."]}
