{"description": "### Impact\nUsers who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions.\n\nThe likelyhood of a user having create permissions but _not_ having edit or delete permissions is low, but it _is_ possible.\n\nNote that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the [`showImportForm` public property](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Admin/ModelAdmin.html#property_showImportForm), nor does it impact the `SecurityAdmin` section.\n\n#### Action may be required\n\nIf you have a custom implementation of [`BulkLoader`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html), you should update your implementation to respect permissions when the return value of [`getCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_getCheckPermissions) is true.\n\nIf you are using any `BulkLoader` in your own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, you should consider passing `true` to [`setCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_setCheckPermissions) if the data is provided by users.\n\n**Base CVSS:** [4.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)\n**Reported by:** Guy Sartorelli from Silverstripe\n\n### References\n- https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2023-49783\n", "methods": ["Users with create permissions can edit or delete records without having edit or delete permissions.", "Users can bypass permission checks using the CSV import form.", "Custom implementations of BulkLoader should update to respect permissions when getCheckPermissions() is true.", "Custom implementations of BulkLoader should pass true to setCheckPermissions() if data is provided by users."]}
