{"description": "The `UserIdentity::is_verified()` method in the matrix-sdk-crypto crate before version 0.7.2 doesn't take into account the verification status of the user's own identity while performing the check and may as a result return a value contrary to what is implied by its name and documentation.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf the method is used to decide whether to perform sensitive operations towards a user identity, a malicious homeserver could manipulate the outcome in order to make the identity appear trusted. This is not a typical usage of the method, which lowers the impact. The method itself is not used inside the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe 0.7.2 release of the `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate includes a fix.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone.\n", "methods": ["Manipulated the outcome of a method to make a user identity appear trusted."]}
