{"description": "### Impact\n\nThis GitHub Action creates a CSV file without sanitizing the output of the APIs.  If an alert is dismissed or any other custom field contains executable code / formulas, it might be run when an endpoint opens that CSV file in a spreadsheet program.  The data flow looks like this ?? \n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A(Repository) -->|developer dismissal, other data input| B(GitHub Advanced Security data)\n    B -->|ghas-to-csv| C(CSV file)\n    C -->|spreadsheet program| D(endpoint executes potentially malicious code)\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nPlease use version `v1` or later.  That tag moves from using `csv` to `defusedcsv` to mitigate this problem.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround.  Please upgrade to using the latest tag, `v1` (or later).\n\n### References\n\n* CWE-1236 information from [MITRE](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1236.html)\n* CSV injection information from [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection)\n* CodeQL query for CWE-1236 in Python [here](https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/main/python/ql/src/experimental/Security/CWE-1236)\n* PyPI site for `defusedcsv` [here](https://pypi.org/project/defusedcsv/)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in this repository [here](https://github.com/some-natalie/ghas-to-csv/issues)\n", "methods": ["Uses Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File to execute potentially malicious code.", "Creates a CSV file without sanitizing the output of APIs.", "Allows executable code or formulas to be run when the CSV file is opened in a spreadsheet program."]}
