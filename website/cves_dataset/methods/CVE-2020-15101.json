{"description": "### Impact\nA directory structure of more than 1000 nested directories can interrupt a freewvs scan due to Python's recursion limit and os.walk(). This can be problematic in a case where an administrator scans the dirs of potentially untrusted users.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed in this commit by limiting the recursion to 500 directories:\nhttps://github.com/schokokeksorg/freewvs/commit/83a6b55c0435c69f447488b791555e6078803143\n\nThis issue was discovered by Hanno B\u00f6ck.", "methods": ["Used a directory structure with more than 1000 nested directories to interrupt a freewvs scan.", "Used Python's recursion limit and os.walk() to cause a scan interruption."]}
