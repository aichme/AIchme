{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe ERC721Consecutive contract designed for minting NFTs in batches does not update balances when a batch has size 1 and consists of a single token. Subsequent transfers from the receiver of that token may overflow the balance as reported by `balanceOf`.\n\nThe issue exclusively presents with batches of size 1.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been patched in 4.8.2.\n\n<!-- ### References -->\n\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in a smart contract to overflow a balance.", "Used a vulnerability in a smart contract to update balances incorrectly.", "Used a vulnerability in a smart contract to create a security issue with batch transfers."]}
