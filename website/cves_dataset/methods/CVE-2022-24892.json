{"description": "### Impact\nMultiple tokens for password reset could be requested. All tokens could be used to change the password.\nThis makes it possible for an attacker to take over the victims account if s/he gains access to the victims email account and finds unused password reset token in the emails within the time frame of two hours.\n\n### Patches\nWe recommend updating to the current version 5.7.9. You can get the update to 5.7.9 regularly via the Auto-Updater or directly via the download overview.\nhttps://www.shopware.com/en/changelog-sw5/#5-7-9\n\nFor older versions you can use the Security Plugin:\nhttps://store.shopware.com/en/swag575294366635f/shopware-security-plugin.html\n\n\n### References\nhttps://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-5-en/security-updates/security-update-04-2022", "methods": ["Multiple tokens for password reset could be requested.", "Tokens could be used to change the password.", "Gains access to the victim's email account.", "Finds unused password reset token in the emails within two hours.", "Uses tokens to take over the victim's account."]}
