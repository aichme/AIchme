{"description": "### Impact\n\nBy frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all.\n\nThis impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the `GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nSubmit the proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning protection.\n\n### Credit\n\nReported by Lior Abadi and Joaquin Pereyra from Coinspect.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://www.coinspect.com/openzeppelin-governor-dos/", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the Governor contract to gain ability to cancel proposal creation.", "Used frontrunning to become proposer and gain ability to cancel proposal creation.", "Used repeated attempts to prevent proposal creation.", "Used an endpoint without frontrunning protection to submit proposal creation transaction."]}
