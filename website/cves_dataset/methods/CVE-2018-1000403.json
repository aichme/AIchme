{"description": "Jenkins project Jenkins AWS CodeDeploy Plugin version 1.19 and earlier contains a Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in AWSCodeDeployPublisher.java that can result in Credentials Disclosure. This attack appears to be exploitable via local file access. \n\nAWS CodeDeploy Plugin 1.20 and newer stores the AWS Secret Key encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text. Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text secret keys to be overwritten.", "methods": ["Stored AWS Secret Key in plain text.", "Credentials Disclosure via local file access.", "Insufficiently Protected Credentials."]}
