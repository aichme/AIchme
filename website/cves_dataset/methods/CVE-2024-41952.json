{"description": "### Impact\n\nZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called \"Ignoring unknown usernames\" which helps mitigate attacks that try to guess/enumerate usernames. If enabled, ZITADEL will show the password prompt even if the user doesn't exist and report \"Username or Password invalid\".\nDue to a implementation change to prevent deadlocks calling the database, the flag would not be correctly respected in all cases and an attacker would gain information if an account exist within ZITADEL, since the error message shows \"object not found\" instead of the generic error message.\n\n### Patches\n\n2.x versions are fixed on >= [2.58.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.58.1)\n2.57.x versions are fixed on >= [2.57.1](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.57.1)\n2.56.x versions are fixed on >= [2.56.2](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.56.2)\n2.55.x versions are fixed on >= [2.55.5](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.55.5)\n2.54.x versions are fixed on >= [2.54.8](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.54.8)\n2.53.x versions are fixed on >= [2.53.9](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/releases/tag/v2.53.9)\n\nZITADEL recommends upgrading to the latest versions available in due course.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround since a patch is already available.\n\n### Questions\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security@zitadel.com](mailto:security@zitadel.com)", "methods": ["Implemented a vulnerability in ZITADEL that allows an attacker to gain information about the existence of an account.", "Implemented a vulnerability in ZITADEL that allows an attacker to bypass the \"Ignoring unknown usernames\" setting.", "Implemented a vulnerability in ZITADEL that allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information about the system."]}
