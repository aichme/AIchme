{"description": "There is a vulnerability in rails-ujs that allows attackers to send CSRF tokens to wrong domains.\n\nVersions Affected:  rails <= 6.0.3\nNot affected:       Applications which don't use rails-ujs.\nFixed Versions:     rails >= 5.2.4.3, rails >= 6.0.3.1\n\nImpact\n------\n\nThis is a regression of CVE-2015-1840.\n\nIn the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the href attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag that will trigger a POST action, the attacker can set the href or action to a cross-origin URL, and the CSRF token will be sent.\n\nWorkarounds\n-----------\n\nTo work around this problem, change code that allows users to control the href attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag to filter the user parameters.\n\nFor example, code like this:\n\n    link_to params\n\nto code like this:\n\n    link_to filtered_params\n\n    def filtered_params\n      # Filter just the parameters that you trust\n    end", "methods": ["Manipulates cross-origin URLs in anchor tags or form actions to send CSRF tokens.", "Allows users to control the href attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag.", "Uses user-controlled parameters to trigger a POST action.", "Fails to filter user parameters in certain code."]}
