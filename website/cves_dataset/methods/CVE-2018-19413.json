The vulnerability occurs because of improperly configured access controls that cause the API to return the externalIdentity field to non-administrator users. The attacker could use this information in subsequent attacks against the system.", "methods": ["Exposed sensitive information to an unauthorized actor through the SonarSource SonarQube API.", "Exploited improperly configured access controls.", "Used API to obtain valid user-account logins."]}
