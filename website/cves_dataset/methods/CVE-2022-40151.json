{"description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application with a stack overflow error resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.20 handles the stack overflow and raises an InputManipulationException instead.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only solution is to catch the StackOverflowError in the client code calling XStream.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2022-40151](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2022-40151.html).\n\n### Credits\nThe vulnerability was discovered and reported by Henry Lin of the Google OSS-Fuzz team.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n", "methods": ["Injects deeply nested objects to cause a stack overflow error.", "Manipulates the processed input stream to terminate the application.", "Uses a stack overflow error to cause a Denial of Service.", "Uses an InputManipulationException to handle the stack overflow."]}
