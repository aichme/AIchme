{"description": "In Apache Linkis <=1.3.0 when used with the MySQL Connector/J, an authenticated attacker could read arbitrary local file by connecting a rogue mysql server, By adding allowLoadLocalInfile to true in the jdbc parameter. Therefore, the parameters in the jdbc url should be blacklisted. Versions of Apache Linkis <= 1.3.0 will be affected. We recommend users upgrade the version of Linkis to version 1.3.1", "methods": ["Used a rogue MySQL server to read arbitrary local files.", "Leveraged the jdbc parameter to allow loading of local files.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Apache Linkis <=1.3.0."]}
