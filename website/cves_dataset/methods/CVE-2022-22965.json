{"description": "Spring Framework prior to versions 5.2.20 and 5.3.18 contains a remote code execution vulnerability known as `Spring4Shell`. \n\n## Impact\n\nA Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\nThese are the prerequisites for the exploit:\n- JDK 9 or higher\n- Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container\n- Packaged as WAR\n- `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency\n\n## Patches\n\n- Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE)\n- Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)\n\n## Workarounds\n\nFor those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.\n\nTo apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux).", "methods": ["Exploits a remote code execution vulnerability in Spring Framework.", "Requires JDK 9 or higher.", "Requires Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container.", "Requires packaged as WAR.", "Uses data binding to execute code.", "Uses `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency.", "Uses `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` as a workaround.", "Extends `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update `WebDataBinder`.", "Uses `WebMvcRegistrations` or `WebFluxRegistrations` bean to update `WebDataBinder`."]}
