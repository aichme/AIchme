{"description": "Jenkins OWASP Dependency-Track Plugin 3.1.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing \\\"Secret text\\\" credentials stored in Jenkins. If no credentials ID is specified, the globally configured credential is used, if set up, and can likewise be captured.\n\nAdditionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nJenkins OWASP Dependency-Track Plugin 3.1.1 requires POST requests and appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.", "methods": ["Used a CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins OWASP Dependency-Track Plugin.", "Used a lack of permission checks in Jenkins OWASP Dependency-Track Plugin HTTP endpoints.", "Captured credentials stored in Jenkins using an attacker-specified URL and credentials IDs.", "Used a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Jenkins OWASP Dependency-Track Plugin."]}
