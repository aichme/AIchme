{"description": "### Impact\nangular-server-side-configuration detects used environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written to a ngssc.json file in the output directory.\nDuring deployment of an Angular based app, the environment variables based on the variables from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined index file).\n\nWith version 15 the environment variable detection was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected and written to the ngssc.json, which would then be populated and exposed via index.html.\n\nThis has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular project that has no backend component.\n\n### Patches\nVulnerability has been mitigated in 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts the detection file range by default.\n\n```bash\n# Update via npm\nnpm update angular-server-side-configuration\n## Or more specific\nnpm install angular-server-side-configuration@15.1.0\n\n# Update via pnpm\npnpm update angular-server-side-configuration\n## Or more specific\npnpm add angular-server-side-configuration@15.1.0\n\n# Update via yarn\nyarn update angular-server-side-configuration\n## Or more specific\nyarn add angular-server-side-configuration@15.1.0\n```\n\n### Workarounds\nManually edit or create ngssc.json or run a script after ngssc.json generation\n\n### References\n\n", "methods": ["Information disclosure via environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files.", "Exposure of environment variables via index.html.", "Detection of environment variables in the entire project, relative to the angular.json file.", "Exposing backend/service environment variables via index.html in a monorepo setup."]}
