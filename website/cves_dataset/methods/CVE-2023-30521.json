This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs corresponding to the attacker-specified repository.", "methods": ["Used a missing authentication vulnerability in the Jenkins Assembla merge request builder Plugin to access the `/assembla-webhook/` endpoint.", "Triggers builds of jobs corresponding to a specified repository without authentication."]}
