{"description": "### Impact\n\nAny user with edit rights on any document (e.g., the own user profile) can execute code with programming rights, leading to remote code execution by following these steps:\n\n1. Set the title of any document you can edit (can be the user profile) to\n```\n    {{async async=\"true\" cached=\"false\" context=\"doc.reference\"}}{{groovy}}println(\"Hello \" + \"from groovy!\"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}\n```\n2. Use the object editor to add an object of type `XWiki.TemplateProviderClass` (named \"Template Provider Class\") to that document.\n3. Go to another document you can view (can be the home page) and append `?sheet=XWiki.AdminTemplatesSheet` to the URL.\n\nWhen the attack is successful, a template with name \"Hello from groovy!\" is displayed in the list while on fixed systems, the full title should be displayed.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.8, 14.10.1 and 15.0 RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe vulnerability can be fixed by patching the code in the affected XWiki document as shown in the [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/7bf7094f8ffac095f5d66809af7554c9cc44de09).\n\n### References\n\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20268\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/7bf7094f8ffac095f5d66809af7554c9cc44de09\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Code injection via template provider administration.", "Remote code execution via template injection.", "Use of Groovy scripting to execute code.", "Use of XWiki document manipulation to execute code.", "Use of URL manipulation to access restricted functionality."]}
