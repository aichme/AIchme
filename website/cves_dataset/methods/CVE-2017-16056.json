Delete the package\n2. Clear your npm cache\n3. Ensure it is not present in any other package.json files on your system\n4. Regenerate your registry credentials, tokens, and any other sensitive credentials that may have been present in your environment variables. \n\nAdditionally, any service which may have been exposed via credentials in your environment variables, such as a database, should be reviewed for indicators of compromise as well.", "methods": ["Uses a malicious package to steal environment variables.", "Uses the npm registry to distribute malware.", "Uses environment variables to store sensitive credentials.", "Uses credentials to access a database service."]}
