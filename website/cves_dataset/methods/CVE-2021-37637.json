{"description": "### Impact\nIt is possible to trigger a null pointer dereference in TensorFlow by passing an invalid input to `tf.raw_ops.CompressElement`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.CompressElement(components=[[]])\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorflow/core/data/compression_utils.cc#L34) was accessing the size of a buffer obtained from the return of a separate function call before validating that said buffer is valid.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5dc7f6981fdaf74c8c5be41f393df705841fb7c5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5dc7f6981fdaf74c8c5be41f393df705841fb7c5).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for  more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360. Concurrently, it was resolved in `master` branch as it was also discovered internally and fixed before the report was handled.", "methods": ["Null pointer dereference in `CompressElement` function.", "Triggered by passing an invalid input to `tf.raw_ops.CompressElement`.", "Implementation accessed the size of a buffer without validating its validity.", "Patched in GitHub commit 5dc7f6981fdaf74c8c5be41f393df705841fb7c5.", "Fixed in TensorFlow 2.6.0 and backported to 2.5.1, 2.4.3, and 2.3.4."]}
