{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of SobolSampleOp is vulnerable to a denial of service via CHECK-failure (assertion failure) caused by assuming `input(0)`, `input(1)`, and `input(2)` to be scalar.\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.SobolSample(dim=tf.constant([1,0]), num_results=tf.constant([1]), skip=tf.constant([1]))\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf).\n\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by:\n- Kang Hong Jin from Singapore Management University\n- Neophytos Christou, Secure Systems Labs, Brown University\n- \u5218\u529b\u6e90, Information System & Security and Countermeasures Experiments Center, Beijing Institute of Technology\n", "methods": ["Missing input validation in TensorFlow's SobolSampleOp implementation.", "Denial of Service (DoS) via CHECK-failure (assertion failure)."]}
