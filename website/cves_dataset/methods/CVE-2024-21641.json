{"description": "### Impact\nThe Flarum `/logout` route includes a redirect parameter that allows any third party to redirect users from a (trusted) domain of the Flarum installation to redirect to any link. Sample: `example.com/logout?return=https://google.com`. For logged-in users, the logout must be confirmed. Guests are immediately redirected. This could be used by spammers to redirect to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation.\n\nSome ecosystem extensions modifying the logout route have already been affected. Sample: https://discuss.flarum.org/d/22229-premium-wordpress-integration/526\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.8.5. All communities running Flarum should upgrade as soon as possible to v1.8.5 using:\n\n`composer update --prefer-dist --no-dev -a -W`\n\nYou can then confirm you run the latest version using:\n\n`composer show flarum/core`\n\n### Workarounds\nSome extensions modifying the logout route can remedy this issue if their implementation is safe. In any case we recommend updating to 1.8.5.\n\n### References\nFor any questions or comments on this vulnerability, please visit https://discuss.flarum.org/\n\nFor support questions, create a discussion at https://discuss.flarum.org/t/support.\n\nA reminder that if you ever become aware of a security issue in Flarum, please report it to us privately by emailing [security@flarum.org](mailto:security@flarum.org), and we will address it promptly.", "methods": ["Allows open redirects to any link via the `/logout` route.", "Allows spammers to redirect users to a web address using a trusted domain of a running Flarum installation."]}
