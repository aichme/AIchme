{"description": "### Impact\nWhen opening a form in Valtimo, the access token (JWT) of the user is exposed to `api.form.io` via the the `x-jwt-token` header. An attacker can retrieve personal information from this token, or use it to execute requests to the Valtimo REST API on behalf of the logged-in user.\n\nThis issue is caused by a misconfiguration of the Form.io component.\n\n### Attack requirements ###\nThe following conditions have to be met in order to perform this attack:\n- An attacker needs to have access to the network traffic on the `api.form.io` domain.\n- The content of the `x-jwt-token` header is logged or otherwise available to the attacker.\n- An attacker needs to have network access to the Valtimo API.\n- An attacker needs to act within the time-to-live of the access token. The default TTL in Keycloak is 5 minutes.\n\n### Patches\nVersions 10.8.4, 11.1.6 and 11.2.2 have been patched", "methods": ["Exposes access token to a third-party service (api.form.io) via the x-jwt-token header.", "Uses a misconfigured component (Form.io) to gain unauthorized access to the Valtimo REST API.", "Uses a JWT token to execute requests on behalf of a logged-in user.", "Uses network access to the Valtimo API to perform unauthorized actions.", "Uses network access to the api.form.io domain to intercept sensitive information."]}
