The issue occurs in the [set operation](https://flitbit.github.io/json-ptr/classes/_src_pointer_.jsonpointer.htmlset) when the force flag is set to true. The function recursively set the property in the target object, however it does not properly check the key being set, leading to a prototype pollution.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable npm package (json-ptr) for code execution.", "Executed arbitrary code through prototype pollution.", "Leveraged a recursive function to set properties in an object."]}
