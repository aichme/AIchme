{"description": "A flaw was found in Keycloak. An active keycloak session can be hijacked by initiating a new authentication (having the query parameter prompt=login) and forcing the user to enter his credentials once again. If the user cancels this re-authentication by clicking Restart login, the account takeover could take place as the new session, with a different SUB, will have the same SID as the previous session.\n\n", "methods": ["Session hijacking via re-authentication.", "Forcing user to enter credentials.", "Cancelling re-authentication to take over account."]}
