{"description": "### Impact \nThe [implementation of `StringNGrams`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/string_ngrams_op.cc#L29-L161) can be used to trigger a denial of service attack by causing an OOM condition after an integer overflow:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.StringNGrams(\n  data=['123456'],\n  data_splits=[0,1],\n  separator='a'*15,\n  ngram_widths=[],\n  left_pad='',\n  right_pad='',\n  pad_width=-5, \n  preserve_short_sequences=True)\n```\n\nWe are missing a validation on `pad_witdh` and that result in computing a negative value for `ngram_width` which is later used to allocate parts of the output.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f68fdab93fb7f4ddb4eb438c8fe052753c9413e8](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f68fdab93fb7f4ddb4eb438c8fe052753c9413e8).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team.", "methods": ["Used a denial of service attack to cause an OOM condition.", "Exploited an integer overflow vulnerability in the `StringNGrams` implementation.", "Failed to validate user input, specifically the `pad_width` parameter."]}
