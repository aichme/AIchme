{"description": "A security vulnerability has been identified in the Fiber session middleware where a user can supply their own session_id value, leading to the creation of a session with that key.\n\n## Impact\nThe identified vulnerability is a session middleware issue in GoFiber versions 2 and above. This vulnerability allows users to supply their own session_id value, resulting in the creation of a session with that key. If a website relies on the mere presence of a session for security purposes, this can lead to significant security risks, including unauthorized access and session fixation attacks. All users utilizing GoFiber's session middleware in the affected versions are impacted.\n\n## Patches\nThe issue has been addressed in the latest patch. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to version 2.52.5 or higher to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\n## Workarounds\nUsers who are unable to upgrade immediately can apply the following workarounds to reduce the risk:\n\n1. **Validate Session IDs**: Implement additional validation to ensure session IDs are not supplied by the user and are securely generated by the server.\n2. **Session Management**: Regularly rotate session IDs and enforce strict session expiration policies.\n\n## References\nFor more information on session best practices:\n- [OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Session_Management_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\nUsers are encouraged to review these references and take immediate action to secure their applications.", "methods": ["Allows users to supply their own session_id value.", "Creates a session with a user-supplied session_id value.", "Allows unauthorized access.", "Enables session fixation attacks.", "Validates session IDs.", "Generates session IDs securely on the server.", "Rotates session IDs.", "Enforces strict session expiration policies."]}
