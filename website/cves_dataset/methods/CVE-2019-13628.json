{"description": "wolfSSL and wolfCrypt 4.0.0 and earlier (when configured without `--enable-fpecc`, `--enable-sp`, or` --enable-sp-math`) contain a timing side channel in ECDSA signature generation. This allows a local attacker, able to precisely measure the duration of signature operations, to infer information about the nonces used and potentially mount a lattice attack to recover the private key used. The issue occurs because ecc.c scalar multiplication might leak the bit length.", "methods": ["Leaks cryptographic information via timing side channel.", "Uses a timing side channel in ECDSA signature generation.", "Allows a local attacker to infer information about nonces used.", "Allows a local attacker to mount a lattice attack to recover the private key used.", "Leaks information about the bit length of ecc.c scalar multiplication."]}
