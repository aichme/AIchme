{"description": "### Impact\n\nAll users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 <= 6.4.1` does not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allows invalid XML documents to trick the verification process, by presenting elements with a valid signature inside elements whose content has been malformed. The verification is offloaded to `xmlsec1` and `xmlsec1` will not validate every signature in the given document, but only the first it finds in the given scope.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to pysaml2 `v6.5.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround provided at this point.\n\n### References\n\nNo references provided at this point.\n\n### Credits\n\n- Victor Scho\u0308nfelder Garcia (isits AG International School of IT Security)\n- Juraj Somorovsky (Paderborn University)\n- Vladislav Mladenov (Ruhr University Bochum)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [pysaml2](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2)\n* Email us at [the incident-response address](mailto:incident-response@idpy.org)", "methods": ["Used SAML XML Signature wrapping to trick the verification process.", "Failed to validate SAML document against an XML schema.", "Failed to validate every signature in the document, only the first signature found in the scope was validated."]}
