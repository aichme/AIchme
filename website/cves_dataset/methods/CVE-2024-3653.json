{"description": "A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This issue requires enabling the learning-push handler in the server's config, which is disabled by default, leaving the maxAge config in the handler unconfigured. The default is -1, which makes the handler vulnerable. If someone overwrites that config, the server is not subject to the attack. The attacker needs to be able to reach the server with a normal HTTP request.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in a web server.", "Used HTTP requests to reach the server.", "Modified server configuration to enable a handler.", "Failed to properly configure a handler's maxAge setting."]}
