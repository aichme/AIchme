{"description": "### Impact\nThe processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects.  XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information.  An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in the deletion of a file on the local host. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nIf you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-21343](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-21343.html).\n\n### Credits\n\u949f\u6f66\u8d35 (Liaogui Zhong) found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)", "methods": ["Manipulated input stream to inject objects that result in file deletion on the local host.", "Created new instances based on manipulated type information.", "Exploited XStream's default blacklist to achieve arbitrary file deletion.", "Used a whitelist to limit the types of objects that can be created.", "Required at least version 1.4.16 of XStream's security framework to mitigate the vulnerability."]}
