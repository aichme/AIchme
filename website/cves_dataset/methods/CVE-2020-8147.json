{"description": "All versions of `utils-extend` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. The `extend` function does not restrict the modification of an Object's prototype, which may allow an attacker to add or modify an existing property that will exist on all objects.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable package (`utils-extend`) to pollute an Object's prototype.", "Added or modified an existing property on all objects.", "Used a vulnerable package without a fix available.", "Considered using an alternative package."]}
