{"description": "An improper authorization vulnerability exists in Jenkins Jira Plugin 3.0.1 and earlier in JiraSite.java that allows attackers with Overall/Read access to have Jenkins connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins. In version 3.0.2, this form validation method requires POST requests and Overall/Administer (for globally defined sites) or Item/Configure permissions (for sites defined for a folder).", "methods": ["Used an improper authorization vulnerability in Jenkins Jira Plugin.", "Used Overall/Read access to obtain credentials.", "Used Overall/Administer or Item/Configure permissions to bypass form validation.", "Used POST requests to bypass form validation."]}
