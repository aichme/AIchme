{"description": "A universal cross-site scripting (UXSS) vulnerability, CVE-2020-6506 (https://crbug.com/1083819), has been identified in the Android WebView system component, which allows cross-origin iframes to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the top-level document. This vulnerability affects React Native apps which use a `react-native-webview` that allows navigation to arbitrary URLs, and when that app runs on systems with an Android WebView version prior to 83.0.4103.106.\n\n## Pending mitigation\n\nEnsure users update their Android WebView system component via the Google Play Store to 83.0.4103.106 or higher to avoid this UXSS. 'react-native-webview' is working on a mitigation but it could take some time.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://alesandroortiz.com/articles/uxss-android-webview-cve-2020-6506/\n\n", "methods": ["Used a universal cross-site scripting (UXSS) vulnerability in Android WebView to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the top-level document.", "Exploited a React Native app that uses a `react-native-webview` to navigate to arbitrary URLs.", "Leveraged a vulnerable Android WebView version prior to 83.0.4103.106."]}
