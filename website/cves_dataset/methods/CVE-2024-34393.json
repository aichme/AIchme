{"description": "libxmljs2 is vulnerable to type confusion when parsing a specially crafted XML while invoking a function on the result of attrs() that was called on a parsed node. This vulnerability might lead to denial of service (on both 32-bit systems and 64-bit systems), data leak, infinite loop and remote code execution (on 32-bit systems with the XML_PARSE_HUGE flag enabled). At the time of publication, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Attempted Denial of Service (DoS) via specially crafted XML.", "Data Leak via specially crafted XML.", "Attempted Remote Code Execution via specially crafted XML on 32-bit systems with XML_PARSE_HUGE flag enabled.", "Infinite Loop via specially crafted XML."]}
