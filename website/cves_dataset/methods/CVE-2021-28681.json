{"description": "### Impact\nData channel communication was incorrectly allowed with users who have failed DTLS certificate verification.\n\nThis attack requires \n* Attacker knows the ICE password. \n* Only take place during PeerConnection handshake.\n\nThis attack can be detected by monitoring `PeerConnectionState` in all versions of Pion WebRTC.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to v3.0.15. \n\nThe exact patch is https://github.com/pion/webrtc/commit/545613dcdeb5dedb01cce94175f40bcbe045df2e\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers should listen for when `PeerConnectionState` changes to `PeerConnectionStateFailed`. When it enters this state users should not continue using the PeerConnection.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in https://github.com/pion/webrtc\n* Email us at [team@pion.ly](mailto:team@pion.ly)\n\nThank you to https://github.com/Gaukas for discovering this.", "methods": ["Failed DTLS certificate verification allows data channel communication with unverified users.", "Exploits ICE password to take place during PeerConnection handshake.", "Uses PeerConnectionState to monitor for failed connections.", "Uses PeerConnectionState to detect and prevent data channel communication with unverified users."]}
