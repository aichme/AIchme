{"description": "Affected versions of `yargs-parser` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  \nParsing the argument `--foo.__proto__.bar baz'` adds a `bar` property with value `baz` to all objects. This is only exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `yargs-parser`.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to versions 13.1.2, 15.0.1, 18.1.1 or later.", "methods": ["Manipulated input to pollute the prototype of an object.", "Failed to sanitize arguments, allowing modification of existing properties on all objects.", "Added a property to the prototype of an object."]}
