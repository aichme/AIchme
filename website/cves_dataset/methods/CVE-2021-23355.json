{"description": "This affects all versions of package ps-kill. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the kill function, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This is due to use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization in the index.js file. \n\nPoC (provided by reporter): \n```js\nvar ps_kill = require('ps-kill');\nps_kill.kill('$(touch success)', function() {});\n```", "methods": ["Command and Control: Command Injection in a Node.js package (ps-kill) via unsanitized user input.", "Command and Control: Execution of arbitrary commands via the child_process exec function.", "Command and Control: Execution of arbitrary commands via the kill function with user-controlled input.", "Command and Control: Execution of arbitrary commands via the touch command."]}
