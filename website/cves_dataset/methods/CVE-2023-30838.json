{"description": "### Impact\nValidateCore::isCleanHTML() method of Prestashop misses hijickable events which can lead to XSS injection, allowed by the presence of pre-setup @keyframes methods.\n\nThis XSS which hijacks HTML attributes will be triggered without any interaction of the visitor/administrator which makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS.\n\nContrary to most XSS which target HTML attributes and which are triggered without user interaction (such as onload / onerror which suffer from a very limited scope), this one can hijack every HTML element, which increases the danger due to a complete HTML elements scope.\n\n### Patches\nThe patch will be on PS 8.0.4 and PS 1.7.8.9\n\n### References\n", "methods": ["Possible XSS injection through Validate::isCleanHTML method.", "Injects malicious code through hijackable events.", "Triggers XSS without user interaction.", "Hijacks HTML elements.", "Uses pre-setup @keyframes methods.", "Targets HTML attributes.", "Uses limited scope XSS (onload, onerror).", "Uses complete HTML elements scope XSS."]}
