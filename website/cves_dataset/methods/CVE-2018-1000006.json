{"description": "Affected versions of `electron` may be susceptible to a remote code execution flaw when certain conditions are met:\n1. The electron application is running on Windows.\n2. The electron application registers as the default handler for a protocol, such as `nodeapp://`.\n\nThis vulnerability is caused by a failure to sanitize additional arguments to chromium in the command line handler for Electron.\n\nMacOS and Linux are not vulnerable.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate electron to a version that is not vulnerable. If updating is not possible, the electron team has provided the following guidance:\n\n\nIf for some reason you are unable to upgrade your Electron version, you can append `--` as the last argument when calling `app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient`, which prevents Chromium from parsing further options. The double dash `--` signifies the end of command options, after which only positional parameters are accepted.\n```\napp.setAsDefaultProtocolClient(protocol, process.execPath, [\n  '--your-switches-here',\n  '--'\n])\n```", "methods": ["Uses a vulnerability in Electron to execute arbitrary code on Windows systems.", "Uses a protocol handler to execute code.", "Uses a command line handler to execute code.", "Uses a failure to sanitize arguments to execute code."]}
