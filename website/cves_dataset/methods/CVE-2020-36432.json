{"description": "An issue was discovered in the alg_ds crate through 2020-08-25 for Rust. `Matrix::new()` internally calls `Matrix::fill_with()` which uses `*ptr = value` pattern to initialize the buffer. This pattern assumes that there is an initialized struct at the address and drops it, which results in dropping of uninitialized struct.", "methods": ["Used uninitialized memory in a buffer.", "Used a pattern that assumes an initialized struct at an address."]}
