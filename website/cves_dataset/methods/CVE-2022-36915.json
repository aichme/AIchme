{"description": "Jenkins Android Signing Plugin 2.2.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Item/Read permission but without Item/Workspace or Item/Configure permission to check whether attacker-specified file patterns match workspace contents. A sequence of requests can be used to effectively list workspace contents.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the Jenkins Android Signing Plugin to bypass permission checks.", "Used a sequence of requests to list workspace contents.", "Implemented form validation without permission checks."]}
