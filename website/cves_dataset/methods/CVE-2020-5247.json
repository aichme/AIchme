{"description": "In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.2 and 3.12.3, if an application using Puma allows untrusted input in a response header, an attacker can use newline characters (i.e. `CR`, `LF` or`/r`, `/n`) to end the header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP Response Splitting.\n\nWhile not an attack in itself, response splitting is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).\n\nThis is related to CVE-2019-16254, which fixed this vulnerability for the WEBrick Ruby web server.\n\nThis has been fixed in versions 4.3.2 and 3.12.3 by checking all headers for line endings and rejecting headers with those characters.", "methods": ["Injects malicious content into HTTP responses.", "Uses newline characters to end headers and inject content.", "Injects additional headers or an entirely new response body.", "Vector for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks."]}
