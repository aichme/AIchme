{"description": "Flume\u2019s JMSSource class can be configured with a providerUrl parameter. A JNDI lookup is performed on this name without performing validation. This could result in untrusted data being deserialized, leading to remote code execution (RCE) attack when a configuration uses a JMS Source with an unsafe providerURL. This issue is fixed in version 1.11.0.", "methods": ["Deserialization of untrusted data.", "Remote code execution (RCE) via deserialization.", "JNDI lookup without validation.", "Configuration of a JMS Source with an unsafe providerURL."]}
