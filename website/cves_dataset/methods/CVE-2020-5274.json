{"description": "Description\n-----------\n\nWhen `ErrorHandler` renders an exception HTML page, it uses un-escaped properties from the related Exception class to render the stacktrace. The security issue comes from the fact that the stacktraces were also displayed in non-`debug` environments.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nThe `ErrorHandler` class now escapes all properties coming from the related Exception, and the stacktrace is not displayed anymore in non-`debug` environments.\n\nThe patches for this issue are available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/cf80224589ac05402d4f72f5ddf80900ec94d5ad) and [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/629d21b800a15dc649fb0ae9ed7cd9211e7e45db) for branch 4.4.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nI would like to thank Luka Sikic for reporting & Yonel Ceruto and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Deruss\u00e9 for fixing the issue.", "methods": ["Used an insecure rendering of exception information in non-debug configurations.", "Displayed sensitive information in non-debug environments."]}
