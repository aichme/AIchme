The package fails to sanitize the HTML input, allowing attackers to exfiltrate server files by supplying malicious HTML code. XHR requests in the HTML code are executed by the server.

There is a mitigation available in the provided reference.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary file read to exfiltrate server files.", "Executed XHR requests to access sensitive files."]}
