This could be exploited by a MitM attack.\n\n### References\n* [NO STARTTLS: Similar vulnerabilities discovered by previous researchers.](https://nostarttls.secvuln.info/)", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in aiosmtpd to inject unencrypted commands.", "Conducted a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack."]}
