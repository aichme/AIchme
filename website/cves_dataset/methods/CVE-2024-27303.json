{"description": "### Impact\nWindows-Only: The NSIS installer makes a system call to open cmd.exe via NSExec in the `.nsh` installer script. NSExec by default searches the current directory of where the installer is located before searching `PATH`. This means that if an attacker can place a malicious executable file named cmd.exe in the same folder as the installer, the installer will run the malicious file.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/8059\n\n### Workarounds\nNone, it executes at the installer-level before the app is present on the system, so there's no way to check if it exists in a current installer.\n\n### References\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/426.html\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/427", "methods": ["Executes arbitrary code on the target machine via system call to open cmd.exe.", "Uses a malicious executable file named cmd.exe in the same folder as the installer to execute malicious code.", "Executes at the installer-level before the app is present on the system."]}
