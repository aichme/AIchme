{"description": "# Overview\n\nFor versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, if a malicious actor has the ability to modify the key retrieval parameter (referring to the `secretOrPublicKey` argument from the [readme link](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback)) of the `jwt.verify()` function, they can gain remote code execution (RCE).\n\n# Am I affected?\n\nThis security issue is a concern when the `jsonwebtoken` library is used in an insecure way. Users are affected only if they allow untrusted entities to modify the key retrieval parameter of the `jwt.verify()` on a host that you control. In this scenario, if all the prerequisites are met, the issue may be exploitable. The source of this risk in this scenario would be in the calling code, and not in the library itself.\n\n# How do I fix it?\n\nUsers of jsonwebtoken 8.5.1 and earlier are encouraged to update to the latest version, 9.0.0, which presents safer code and important security checks that fixes this security flaw and others and prevents misuse of the package.", "methods": ["Used insecure input validation in the jwt.verify function.", "Manipulated key retrieval parameter to gain remote code execution (RCE).", "Exploited insecure library usage to gain RCE."]}
