{"description": "### Problem\nRequesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler, which again could retrieve content to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded.\n\nThis vulnerability is very similar, but not identical, to the one described in [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-005](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-005) (CVE-2021-21359).\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33 or 11.5.20 that fix the problem described above.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-012](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-012)", "methods": ["Triggers a Denial of Service (DoS) by recursively calling the application.", "Exploits a vulnerability in the page error handler.", "Uses HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerability.", "Amplifies the impact of the initial attack."]}
