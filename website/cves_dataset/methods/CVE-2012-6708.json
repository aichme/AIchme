This occurs because the main `jquery` function uses a regular expression to differentiate between HTML and selectors, but does not properly anchor the regular expression. The result is that `jquery` may interpret HTML as selectors when given certain inputs, allowing for client side code execution.\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```\n$(\"#log\").html(\n    $(\"element[attribute='<img src=\\\"x\\\" onerror=\\\"alert(1)\\\" />']\").html()\n);\n```\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.9.0 or later.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the jquery library to execute client-side code.", "Executed code through HTML injection.", "Used a regular expression to interpret HTML as selectors.", "Executed code through the use of an onerror event handler."]}
