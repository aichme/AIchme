{"description": "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor, Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information vulnerability in Maven Archetype Plugin.\n\nThis issue affects Maven Archetype Plugin: from 3.2.1 before 3.3.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.3.0, which fixes the issue.\n\nArchetype integration testing creates a file\ncalled ./target/classes/archetype-it/archetype-settings.xml\nThis file contains all the content from the users ~/.m2/settings.xml file,\nwhich often contains information they do not want to publish. We expect that on many developer machines, this also contains\ncredentials.\n\nWhen the user runs mvn verify again (without a mvn clean), this file becomes part of the final artifact.\n\nIf a developer were to publish this into Maven Central or any other remote repository (whether as a release or a snapshot) their credentials would be published without them knowing.", "methods": ["Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information in Maven settings.xml file.", "Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor through published Maven artifacts.", "Insecure Storage of Sensitive Information in Maven Central or remote repositories."]}
