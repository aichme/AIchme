{"description": "**Summary**\n\nMechanize (rubygem) `< v2.8.5` leaks the `Authorization` header after a redirect to a different port on the same site.\n\n**Mitigation**\n\nUpgrade to Mechanize v2.8.5 or later.\n\n**Notes**\n\nSee [https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27776.html](CVE-2022-27776) for a similar vulnerability in curl.\n\nCookies are shared with a server at a different port on the same site, per https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265#section-8.5 which states in part:\n\n> Cookies do not provide isolation by port.  If a cookie is readable\n> by a service running on one port, the cookie is also readable by a\n> service running on another port of the same server.  If a cookie is\n> writable by a service on one port, the cookie is also writable by a\n> service running on another port of the same server.  For this\n> reason, servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting services on\n> different ports of the same host and use cookies to store security-\n> sensitive information.\n", "methods": ["Leaks sensitive information (Authorization header).", "Uses port redirection to bypass security controls.", "Exploits cookie sharing between ports on the same site.", "Uses a vulnerable version of Mechanize (< v2.8.5)."]}
