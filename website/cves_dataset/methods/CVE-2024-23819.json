{"description": "### Summary\nA stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-level privileges to store a JavaScript payload in the GeoServer catalog that will execute in the context of another user's browser when viewed in the MapML HTML Page.  The MapML extension must be installed and access to the MapML HTML Page is available to all users although data security may limit users' ability to trigger the XSS.\n\n### Impact\nIf an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:\n\n1 .Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.\n2. View any information that the user is able to view.\n3. Modify any information that the user is able to modify.\n4. Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user.\n\n### References\nhttps://osgeo-org.atlassian.net/browse/GEOS-11154\nhttps://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/pull/7175\n", "methods": ["Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in GeoServer's MapML HTML Page.", "Executes JavaScript payload in the context of another user's browser.", "Allows an attacker to perform any action within the application that the user can perform.", "Allows an attacker to view any information that the user is able to view.", "Allows an attacker to modify any information that the user is able to modify.", "Allows an attacker to initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks."]}
