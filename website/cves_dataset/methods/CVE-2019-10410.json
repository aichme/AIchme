{"description": "Log Parser Plugin did not escape an error message shown when log parsing patterns are invalid. This resulted in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the log parsing rules configuration, typically users with Job/Configure permission.\n\nJenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\nLog Parser Plugin version 2.1 escapes all variables displayed in its views.", "methods": ["Used a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Log Parser Plugin.", "Exploited a configuration vulnerability in Jenkins to gain access to Job/Configure permission.", "Used a configuration vulnerability to inject malicious code.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Jenkins versions prior to 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2."]}
