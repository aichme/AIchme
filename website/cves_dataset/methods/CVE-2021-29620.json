{"description": "### Impact\nStarting from version 3.1.0 we introduced a new feature of JUnit XML launch import. Unfortunately XML parser was not configured properly to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks. This allows a user to import a specifically-crafted XML file which imports external Document Type Definition (DTD) file with external entities for extraction of secrets from Report Portal service-api module or server-side request forgery.\n\n### Patches\nFixed with: https://github.com/reportportal/service-api/pull/1392\n\n### Binaries\n`docker pull reportportal/service-api:5.4.0`\nhttps://github.com/reportportal/service-api/packages/846871?version=5.4.0\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us: [support@reportportal.io](mailto:support@reportportal.io)\n", "methods": ["Used XXE vulnerability to import a specifically-crafted XML file.", "Imported external Document Type Definition (DTD) file with external entities.", "Extracted secrets from Report Portal service-api module.", "Performed server-side request forgery."]}
