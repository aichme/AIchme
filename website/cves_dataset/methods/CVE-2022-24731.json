{"description": "### Impact\n\nAll unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with v1.5.0 are vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability allowing a malicious user with read/write access to leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server.\n\nA malicious Argo CD user who has been granted [`create` or `update` access to Applications](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-resources-and-actions) can leak the contents of any text file on the repo-server. By crafting a malicious Helm chart and using it in an Application, the attacker can retrieve the sensitive file's contents either as part of the generated manifests or in an error message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the target file.\n\nSensitive files which could be leaked include files from other Application's source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.3.0\n* v2.2.6\n* v2.1.11\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe only certain way to avoid the vulnerability is to upgrade. \n\nTo mitigate the problem, you can \n* avoid storing secrets in git\n* avoid mounting secrets as files on the repo-server\n* avoid decrypting secrets into files on the repo-server\n* carefully [limit who can `create` or `update` Applications](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#rbac-resources-and-actions)\n\n### References\n\n* [Security documentation for the repo-server component](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/security/#git-helm-repositories)\n* [Argo CD RBAC configuration documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/#)\n\n### For more information\n\nOpen an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\nJoin us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n", "methods": ["Leaked sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server by crafting a malicious Helm chart and using it in an Application.", "Retrieved sensitive file contents as part of the generated manifests or in an error message.", "Used knowledge of file locations to target specific files for exfiltration.", "Mounted secrets as files on the repo-server.", "Decrypted secrets into files on the repo-server.", "Used RBAC to grant create or update access to Applications to malicious users.", "Used RBAC to limit who can create or update Applications."]}
