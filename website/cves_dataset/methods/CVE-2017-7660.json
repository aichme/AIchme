{"description": "Apache Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted node name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a malicious node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that the malicious node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have enabled BasicAuth authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which does not implement either \"HttpClientInterceptorPlugin\" or \"HttpClientBuilderPlugin\", his/her servers are vulnerable to this attack. Users who only use SSL without basic authentication or those who use Kerberos are not affected.", "methods": ["Impersonate a legitimate node in a cluster to gain access to sensitive information.", "Exploit insecure inter-node communication to trick nodes into trusting a malicious node.", "Use a specially crafted node name to deceive nodes into authenticating with a malicious node.", "Exploit BasicAuth authentication mechanism without implementing \"HttpClientInterceptorPlugin\" or \"HttpClientBuilderPlugin\".", "Exploit a custom Authentication plugin that does not implement \"HttpClientInterceptorPlugin\" or \"HttpClientBuilderPlugin\"."]}
