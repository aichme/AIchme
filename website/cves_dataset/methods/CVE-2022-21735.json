{"description": "### Impact \nThe [implementation of `FractionalMaxPool`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_max_pool_op.cc#L36-L192) can be made to crash a TensorFlow process via a division by 0:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\ntf.raw_ops.FractionalMaxPool(\n  value=tf.constant(value=[[[[1, 4, 2, 3]]]], dtype=tf.int64),\n  pooling_ratio=[1.0, 1.44, 1.73, 1.0],\n  pseudo_random=False,\n  overlapping=False,\n  deterministic=False,\n  seed=0,\n  seed2=0,\n  name=None)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ba4e8ac4dc2991e350d5cc407f8598c8d4ee70fb](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ba4e8ac4dc2991e350d5cc407f8598c8d4ee70fb).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Faysal Hossain Shezan from University of Virginia.", "methods": ["Division by zero in Tensorflow implementation.", "Use of a GitHub commit to patch the issue.", "Use of a specific version of TensorFlow (2.8.0) to fix the vulnerability.", "Cherrypicking of the commit on other versions (2.7.1, 2.6.3, 2.5.3).", "Use of a security guide for more information.", "Attribution to a specific individual (Faysal Hossain Shezan) for reporting the vulnerability."]}
