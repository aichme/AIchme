{"description": "### Impact\nThe `will-navigate` event that apps use to prevent navigations to unexpected destinations [as per our security recommendations](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security) can be bypassed when a sub-frame performs a top-frame navigation across sites.\n\n### Patches\n\n* `11.0.0-beta.1`\n* `10.0.1`\n* `9.3.0`\n* `8.5.1`\n\n### Workarounds\nSandbox all your iframes using the [`sandbox` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox).  This will prevent them creating top-frame navigations and is good practice anyway.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Email us at security@electronjs.org", "methods": ["Bypassed security feature to navigate to unexpected destinations.", "Used sandbox attribute to prevent iframes from creating top-frame navigations."]}
