{"description": "Apache Camel's camel-jackson and camel-jacksonxml components are vulnerable to Java object\nde-serialisation vulnerability. Camel allows to specify such a type through the 'CamelJacksonUnmarshalType'\nproperty. De-serializing untrusted data can lead to security flaws as demonstrated in various similar reports about Java de-serialization issues.\n\nMitigation: 2.16.x users should upgrade to 2.16.5, 2.17.x users should upgrade to 2.17.5, 2.18.x users should\nupgrade to 2.18.2. \n\nThe JIRA tickets: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-10567 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-10604\nrefers to the various commits that resovoled the issue, and have more details.", "methods": ["Used Java object de-serialisation to execute arbitrary code.", "Used untrusted data to execute arbitrary code.", "Executed arbitrary code through the 'CamelJacksonUnmarshalType' property."]}
