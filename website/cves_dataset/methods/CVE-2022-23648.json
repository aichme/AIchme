{"description": "### Impact\n\nA bug was found in containerd where containers launched through containerd\u2019s CRI implementation with a specially-crafted image configuration could gain access to read-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host.  This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information.  Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd\u2019s CRI implementation.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10 and 1.4.13.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsure that only trusted images are used.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe containerd project would like to thank Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero for responsibly disclosing this issue in accordance with the [containerd security policy](https://github.com/containerd/project/blob/main/SECURITY.md).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at [security@containerd.io](mailto:security@containerd.io)", "methods": ["Bypass User Account Control (UAC) bypass through policy-based enforcement bypass.", "Exposure of Sensitive Information.", "Lateral Movement through access to arbitrary files and directories on the host."]}
