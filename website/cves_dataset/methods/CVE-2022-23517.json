{"description": "## Summary\n\nCertain configurations of rails-html-sanitizer `< 1.4.4` use an inefficient regular expression that is susceptible to excessive backtracking when attempting to sanitize certain SVG attributes. This may lead to a denial of service through CPU resource consumption.\n\n\n## Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to rails-html-sanitizer `>= 1.4.4`.\n\n\n## Severity\n\nThe maintainers have evaluated this as [High Severity 7.5 (CVSS3.1)](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H).\n\n\n## References\n\n- [CWE - CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity (4.9)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html)\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/1684163\n\n\n## Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was responsibly reported by @ooooooo-q (https://github.com/ooooooo-q).\n", "methods": ["Uses an inefficient regular expression in rails-html-sanitizer.", "Causes denial of service through CPU resource consumption.", "Leads to excessive backtracking.", "Exploits CWE-1333: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity."]}
