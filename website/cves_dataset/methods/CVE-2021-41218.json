{"description": "### Impact\nThe [shape inference code for `AllToAll`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/ops/tpu_cross_replica_ops.cc#L25-L74) can be made to execute a division by 0:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \n@tf.function\ndef func():\n  return tf.raw_ops.AllToAll(\n    input=[0.0, 0.1652, 0.6543],\n    group_assignment=[1, -1],\n    concat_dimension=0,\n    split_dimension=0,\n    split_count=0)\n\nfunc()\n```\n\nThis occurs whenever the `split_count` argument is 0:\n  \n```cc\nTF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(c->GetAttr(\"split_count\", &split_count));\n...                  \nfor (int32_t i = 0; i < rank; ++i) {      \n  ...                                     \n  dims[i] = c->MakeDim(c->Value(dims[i]) / split_count);\n  ...                \n}\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a8ad3e5e79c75f36edb81e0ba3f3c0c5442aeddc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a8ad3e5e79c75f36edb81e0ba3f3c0c5442aeddc).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Integer division by 0 in `tf.raw_ops.AllToAll` function.", "Exploitation of a division by 0 vulnerability in TensorFlow code."]}
