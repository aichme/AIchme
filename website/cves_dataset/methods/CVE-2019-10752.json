{"description": "Affected versions of `sequelize` are vulnerable to SQL Injection. The function `sequelize.json()` incorrectly formatted sub paths for JSON queries, which allows attackers to inject SQL statements and execute arbitrary SQL queries if user input is passed to the query.  Exploitation example:  \n\n```js\nreturn User.findAll({\n  where: this.sequelize.json(\"data.id')) AS DECIMAL) = 1 DELETE YOLO INJECTIONS; -- \", 1)\n});\n```\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf you are using `sequelize` 5.x, upgrade to version 5.15.1 or later.\nIf you are using `sequelize` 4.x, upgrade to version 4.44.3 or later.", "methods": ["Injects malicious SQL statements into JSON queries.", "Executes arbitrary SQL queries.", "Uses user input to inject malicious SQL.", "Exploits incorrect formatting of sub paths for JSON queries."]}
