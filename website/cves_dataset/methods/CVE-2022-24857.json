{"description": "### Impact\n\ndjango-mfa3 is a library that implements multi factor authentication for the django web framework. It achieves this by modifying the regular login view. Django however has a second login view for its admin area. This second login view was not modified, so the multi factor authentication can be bypassed.\n\nYou are affected if you have activated both django-mfa3 (< 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin and have not taken any other measures to prevent users from accessing the admin login view.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in django-mfa3 0.5.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIt is possible to work around the issue by overwriting the admin login route, e.g. by adding the following URL definition *before* the admin routes:\n\n    url('admin/login/', lambda request: redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL)\n\n### References\n\n- [django-mfa3 changelog](https://github.com/xi/django-mfa3/blob/main/CHANGES.md#050-2022-04-15)\n", "methods": ["Bypassed multi-factor authentication by accessing the admin login view.", "Exploited an unmodified login view in Django's admin area.", "Failed to authenticate due to a vulnerability in django-mfa3 (< 0.5.0)."]}
