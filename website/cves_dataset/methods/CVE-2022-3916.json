{"description": "An issue was discovered in Keycloak when using a client with the `offline_access` scope. Reuse of session ids across root and user authentication sessions and a lack of root session validation enabled attackers to resolve a user session attached to a different previously authenticated user.\n\nThis issue most affects users of shared computers. Suppose a user logs out of their account (without clearing their cookies) in a mobile app or similar client that includes the `offline_access` scope, and another user authenticates to the application. In that case, it will share the same root session id, and when utilizing the refresh token, they will be issued a token for the original user.", "methods": ["Used session reuse across root and user authentication sessions.", "Failed to validate root session.", "Exploited OIDC offline refresh tokens.", "Leveraged shared computers for session hijacking.", "Utilized client-side session persistence through cookies."]}
