{"description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability allows renderers to obtain access to a random bluetooth device via the [web bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) if the app has not configured a custom `select-bluetooth-device` event handler.  The device that is accessed is random and the attacker would have no way of selecting a specific device.\n\nAll current stable versions of Electron are affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched and the following Electron versions contain the fix:\n* `17.0.0-alpha.6`\n* `16.0.6`\n* `15.3.5`\n* `14.2.4`\n* `13.6.6`\n\n### Workarounds\nAdding this code to your app can workaround the issue.\n\n```js\napp.on('web-contents-created', (event, webContents) => {\n  webContents.on('select-bluetooth-device', (event, devices, callback) => {\n    // Prevent default behavior\n    event.preventDefault();\n    // Cancel the request\n    callback('');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nFor more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at security@electronjs.org.", "methods": ["Uses the web Bluetooth API to access a random Bluetooth device without permission.", "Uses the web Bluetooth API to access a random Bluetooth device without a custom select-bluetooth-device event handler.", "Uses the web Bluetooth API to access a random Bluetooth device without user consent.", "Uses the web Bluetooth API to access a random Bluetooth device without user selection."]}
