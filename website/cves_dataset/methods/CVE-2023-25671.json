{"description": "### Impact\nOut-of-bounds access due to mismatched integer type sizes in ValueMap::Manager::GetValueOrCreatePlaceholder. Bug with tfg-translate call to InitMlir. The problem happens with generic functions, as it is already handled for non-generic functions. This is because they, unlike non-generic functions, are using the \"old importer\". A better long-term solution may be to have the \"new importer\" handle generic functions.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub\n- commit [760322a71ac9033e122ef1f4b1c62813021e5938](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/760322a71ac9033e122ef1f4b1c62813021e5938).\n- commit [2eedc8f676d2c3b8be9492e547b2bc814c10b367](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/2eedc8f676d2c3b8be9492e547b2bc814c10b367)\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by r3pwnx\n\n### Affiliation\n360 AIVul\n\n", "methods": ["None."]}
