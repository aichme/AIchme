{"description": "### Summary\n\nThe traefik docker container uses 100% CPU when it serves as its own backend, which is an automatically generated route resulting from the Docker integration in the default configuration.\n\n### Details\n\nWhile attempting to set up Traefik to handle traffic for Docker containers, I observed in the webUI a rule with the following information:\n\n`Host(traefik-service) | webwebsecure | traefik-service@docker | traefik-service`\n\nI assumed that this is something internal; however, I wondered why it would have a host rule on the web entrypoint configured.\n\nSo I have send a request with that hostname with `curl -v --resolve \"traefik-service:80:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx\" http://traefik-service`. That made my whole server unresponsive.\n\nI assume the name comes from a docker container with that name, traefik itself:\n```\nlocalhost ~ # docker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                                   COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS         PORTS                                                                                                NAMES\nd1414e74aec7   traefik:v2.10                                           \"/entrypoint.sh trae\u2026\"   4 minutes ago       Up 4 minutes   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, :::80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, :::443->443/tcp, 127.0.0.1:8080->8080/tcp   traefik.service\n```\n\n### PoC\n\n1. Start traefik with `docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 80:80 --name foo -p 8080:8080 traefik:v2.10 --api.insecure=true --providers.docker`\n\n2. `curl -v --resolve \"foo:80:127.0.0.1\" http://foo`\n\nlooks like this creates an endless loop of request.\n\nKnowing the name of the docker container seems to be enough to trigger this, if the docker backend is used.\n\n### Impact\n\nServer is unreachable and uses 100% CPU", "methods": ["The Traefik docker container uses 100% CPU when serving as its own backend, resulting from an automatically generated route from the Docker integration in the default configuration.", "The Traefik docker container can be made unresponsive by sending a request with a hostname that matches the name of the container.", "Sending a request with a hostname that matches the name of the container can create an endless loop of requests.", "The server becomes unreachable and uses 100% CPU when the docker backend is used."]}
