{"description": "### Impact\nA malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template is able to manipulate the template in a way that writes files to arbitrary paths on the scaffolder-backend host instance.\n\nThis vulnerability can in some situation also be exploited through user input when executing a template, meaning you do not need write access to the templates. This method will not allow the attacker to control the contents of the injected file however, unless the template is also crafted in a specific way that gives control of the file contents.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability is fixed in version `0.15.14` of the `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.\n\n### Workarounds\nThis attack is mitigated by restricting access and requiring reviews when registering or modifying scaffolder templates.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Open an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\n* Visit our chat, linked to in [Backstage README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)\n", "methods": ["Manipulated a registered scaffolder template to write files to arbitrary paths on the scaffolder-backend host instance.", "Exploited user input when executing a template to write files to arbitrary paths.", "Manipulated the contents of an injected file by crafting a template in a specific way."]}
