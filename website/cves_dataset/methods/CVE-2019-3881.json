If Bundler is used in a scenario where the user does not have a writable home directory, an attacker could place malicious code in this directory that would be later loaded and executed.", "methods": ["Used predictable path in `/tmp/` for storing gems.", "Created insecure storage location in `/tmp/`.", "Loaded and executed malicious code from `/tmp/`.", "Used insecure permissions for storage location in `/tmp/`."]}
