{"description": "arr crate contains multiple security issues. Specifically,\n\n1.  It incorrectly implements Sync/Send bounds, which allows to smuggle non-Sync/Send types across the thread boundary.\n2. Index and IndexMut implementation does not check the array bound.\n3. Array::new_from_template() drops uninitialized memory.\n", "methods": ["Incorrectly implements synchronization, allowing non-thread-safe types to be shared across threads.", "Fails to check array bounds in Index and IndexMut implementations.", "Drops uninitialized memory in Array::new_from_template()."]}
