{"description": "In Apache Synapse, by default no authentication is required for Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI). So Apache Synapse 3.0.1 or all previous releases (3.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.0.0, 1.2, 1.1.2, 1.1.1) allows remote code execution attacks that can be performed by injecting specially crafted serialized objects. And the presence of Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 (commons-collections-3.2.1.jar) or previous versions in Synapse distribution makes this exploitable. To mitigate the issue, we need to limit RMI access to trusted users only. Further upgrading to 3.0.1 version will eliminate the risk of having said Commons Collection version. In Synapse 3.0.1, Commons Collection has been updated to 3.2.2 version.", "methods": ["Injected specially crafted serialized objects to perform remote code execution attacks.", "Leveraged the presence of Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 or previous versions to facilitate the attack.", "Limited RMI access to trusted users to mitigate the issue.", "Upgraded to Synapse 3.0.1 to eliminate the risk of having Commons Collection version 3.2.1."]}
