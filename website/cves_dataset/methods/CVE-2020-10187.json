{"description": "### Impact\nInformation disclosure vulnerability. Allows an attacker to see all `Doorkeeper::Application` model attribute values (including secrets) using authorized applications controller if it's enabled (GET /oauth/authorized_applications.json).\n\n### Patches\n\nThese versions have the fix:\n\n* 5.0.3\n* 5.1.1\n* 5.2.5\n* 5.3.2\n\n### Workarounds\nPatch `Doorkeeper::Application` model `#as_json(options = {})` method and define only those attributes you want to expose.\n\nAdditional recommended hardening is to enable application secrets hashing ([guide](https://doorkeeper.gitbook.io/guides/security/token-and-application-secrets)), available since Doorkeeper 5.1. This would render the exposed secret useless.\n\n### References\n\n- Commit with fix: https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/commit/25d038022c2fcad45af5b73f9d003cf38ff491f6\n- https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10187", "methods": ["Exposed sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.", "Used authorized applications controller to access Doorkeeper::Application model attribute values.", "Accessed Doorkeeper::Application model attribute values via GET /oauth/authorized_applications.json.", "Patched in versions 5.0.3, 5.1.1, 5.2.5, 5.3.2.", "Patched by modifying Doorkeeper::Application model #as_json(options = {}) method.", "Hardened by enabling application secrets hashing."]}
