{"description": "Date\u2019s parsing methods including Date.parse are using Regexps internally, some of which are vulnerable against regular expression denial of service. Applications and libraries that apply such methods to untrusted input may be affected.\n\nThe fix limits the input length up to 128 bytes by default instead of changing the regexps. This is because Date gem uses many Regexps and it is possible that there are still undiscovered vulnerable Regexps. For compatibility, it is allowed to remove the limitation by explicitly passing limit keywords as nil like Date.parse(str, limit: nil), but note that it may take a long time to parse.\n\nPlease update the date gem to version 3.2.1, 3.1.2, 3.0.2, and 2.0.1, or later. You can use gem update date to update it. If you are using bundler, please add gem \"date\", \">= 3.2.1\" to your Gemfile. If you import `date` from the standard library rather than as a gem you should update your Ruby install to `3.0.3`, `2.7.5`, `2.6.9` or later.\n\nUsers unable to upgrade may consider using `Date.strptime` instead with a predefined date format\n```ruby\nDate.strptime('2001-02-20', '%Y-%m-%d')\n```", "methods": ["Uses a vulnerable library (Date gem) to parse untrusted input.", "Allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a long input string.", "Allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a long input string to the Date.parse method.", "Allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) by providing a long input string to the Date.strptime method is not vulnerable, but can be used as an alternative."]}
