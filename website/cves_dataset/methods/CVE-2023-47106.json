{"description": "### Summary\nWhen a request is sent to Traefik with a URL fragment, Traefik automatically URL encodes and forwards the fragment to the backend server. This violates the RFC because in the origin-form the URL should only contain the absolute path and the query.\n\nWhen this is combined with another frontend proxy like Nginx, it can be used to bypass frontend proxy URI-based access control\nrestrictions. \n\n### Details\nFor example, we have this Nginx configuration:\n\n```\nlocation /admin {\n     deny all;\n     return 403;\n}\n```\nThis can be bypassed when the attacker is requesting to /#/../admin\n\nThis won\u2019t be vulnerable if the backend server follows the RFC and ignores any characters after the fragment.\n\nHowever, if Nginx is chained with another reverse proxy which automatically URL encode the character # (Traefik) the URL will become\n\n/%23/../admin\n\nAnd allow the attacker to completely bypass the Access Restriction from the Nginx Front-End proxy.\n\nHere is a diagram to summarize the attack:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47447167/278849578-34ca0546-99b4-44c8-8fc8-8e799c1f5069.png)\n\n### PoC\n![image (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47447167/278849597-280f2e80-f2d7-4dd9-9662-b8f488fd5ff2.png)\n\nThis is the POC docker I've set up.  It contains Nginx, Traefik proxies and a backend server running PHP.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLnA0g7N7ZKhLNmHmuJ4JJjV_J2akNMt/view?usp=sharing\n\n### Impact\nThis allows the attacker to completely bypass the Access Restriction from Front-End proxy.", "methods": ["Used a URL fragment to bypass frontend proxy URI-based access control restrictions.", "Combined with another frontend proxy (Nginx) to bypass access control restrictions.", "Used a reverse proxy (Traefik) that automatically URL encodes the character #.", "Exploited a misconfiguration in Traefik that violates the RFC for URL processing.", "Used a Nginx configuration with a deny all rule to restrict access.", "Bypassed the Nginx configuration by manipulating the URL fragment.", "Used a PoC (Proof of Concept) to demonstrate the vulnerability."]}
