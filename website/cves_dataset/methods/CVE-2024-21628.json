{"description": "### Impact\nThe isCleanHtml method is not used on this this form, which makes it possible to store an xss in DB.\nThe impact is low because the html is not interpreted in BO, thanks to twig's escape mechanism.\nIn FO, the xss is effective, but only impacts the customer sending it, or the customer session from which it was sent.\n\nBe careful if you have a module fetching these messages from the DB and displaying it without escaping html.\n\n### Patches\n8.1.x\n\n### Reporter\nReported by Rona Febriana (linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rona-febriana/)", "methods": ["Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in a database from a user-submitted form.", "Stored XSS in a database from an \"add a message form\" in the order detail page.", "Stored XSS in a database from a form that is not sanitized.", "Stored XSS in a database that can be displayed in the Front Office (FO) without escaping HTML."]}
