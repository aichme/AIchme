The function SerializationSessionDataTranscoder.decode() calls ObjectInputStream.readObject() to deserialize a SessionData object without checking the object types. An attacker can create a malicious object, base64 encode it, and place it in the PIPPO_SESSION field of a cookie. Sending this cookie may lead to remote code execution.", "methods": ["Deserialization of untrusted data in Pippo.", "Used base64 encoding to hide malicious data.", "Used cookies to deliver malicious data.", "Executed remote code."]}
