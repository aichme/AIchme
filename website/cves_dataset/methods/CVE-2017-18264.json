{"description": "An issue was discovered in libraries/common.inc.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0 before 4.0.10.20, 4.4.x, 4.6.x, and 4.7.0 prereleases. The restrictions caused by $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false are bypassed under certain PHP versions (e.g., version 5). This can allow the login of users who have no password set even if the administrator has set $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] to false (which is also the default). This occurs because some implementations of the PHP substr function return false when given '' as the first argument.", "methods": ["Bypassed access control by exploiting a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin.", "Exploited a PHP version-specific vulnerability.", "Leveraged a PHP function (substr) with an invalid input to bypass restrictions.", "Exploited a configuration setting ($cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false) to allow unauthorized access."]}
