{"description": "A flaw was found in Ansible Engine, all versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x prior to 2.7.17, 2.8.11, and 2.9.7 respectively, when using ansible_facts as a subkey of itself and promoting it to a variable when inject is enabled, overwriting the ansible_facts after the clean. An attacker could take advantage of this by altering the ansible_facts, such as ansible_hosts, users and any other key data which would lead into privilege escalation or code injection.", "methods": ["Privilege Escalation via altered ansible_facts.", "Code Injection via ansible_facts overwriting.", "Privilege Escalation via altered key data."]}
