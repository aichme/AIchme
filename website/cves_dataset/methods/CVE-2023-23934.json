{"description": "Browsers may allow \"nameless\" cookies that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain.\n\nWerkzeug <= 2.2.2 will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as `__Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in a web application to set a cookie.", "Exploited a vulnerable browser to set a cookie on an adjacent subdomain.", "Used a vulnerable browser to set a cookie with a nameless format.", "Exploited a vulnerable version of Werkzeug (<= 2.2.2) to parse a malicious cookie."]}
