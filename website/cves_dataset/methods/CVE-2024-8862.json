{"description": "D-Tale is the combination of a Flask back-end and a React front-end to bring you an easy way to view & analyze Pandas data structures. In\u00a0dtale\\views.py, under the route\u00a0@dtale.route(\"/chart-data/<data_id>\"), the query parameters from the request are directly passed into\u00a0run_query\u00a0for execution. And the\u00a0run_query\u00a0function calls proceed without performing any processing or sanitization of the\u00a0query\u00a0parameter. As a result, the\u00a0query\u00a0is directly used in the\u00a0df.query\u00a0method for data retrieval. Tthe\u00a0engine\u00a0used is `python`, which allows executing the query expression ans leading to a command execution vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used a command injection vulnerability in the `df.query` method to execute arbitrary Python code.", "Executed arbitrary Python code using the `python` engine."]}
