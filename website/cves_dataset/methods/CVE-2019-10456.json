{"description": "Jenkins Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.\n\nAdditionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory there is no fix.", "methods": ["Used a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server.", "Used a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability to bypass form validation.", "Used Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server.", "Used a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability to bypass POST request requirements."]}
