{"description": "The NPM module 'deep-set' can be abused by Prototype Pollution vulnerability since the function `deepSet()` does not check for the type of object before assigning value to the property. Due to this flaw an attacker could create a non-existent property or able to manipulate the property which leads to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.\n\n### PoC\n```js\nvar deepSet = require('deep-set')\nvar obj = {'1':'2'}\nconsole.log(obj.isAdmin);\ndeepSet(obj, '__proto__.isAdmin', 'true')\nconsole.log(obj.isAdmin);\n```", "methods": ["Used Prototype Pollution to create a non-existent property or manipulate an existing one.", "Used Prototype Pollution to lead to Denial of Service or potentially Remote code execution.", "Used a vulnerability in the 'deep-set' NPM module to exploit Prototype Pollution."]}
