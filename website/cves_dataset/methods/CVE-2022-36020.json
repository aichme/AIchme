This allows to by-pass the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to `typo3/html-sanitizer` versions 1.0.7 or 2.0.16 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to David Klein who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 security team member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n", "methods": ["Used a parsing issue in the `masterminds/html5` package to bypass cross-site scripting protection.", "Exploited a vulnerability in `typo3/html-sanitizer` to inject malicious markup."]}
