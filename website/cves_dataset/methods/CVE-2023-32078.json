{"description": "### Impact\nAn IDOR vulnerability was found in the user update function. By specifying another user's username it is possible to update the other user's password.\n\n### Patches\nIssue is patched in 0.17.1, and fixed in 0.18.6+.\n\nIf Users are using 0.17.1, they should run \"docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1\" and \"docker-compose up -d\". This will switch them to the patched users\n\nIf users are using v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf using 0.17.1, can just pull the latest docker image of backend and restart server.\n\n### References\nCredit to Project Discovery, and in particular https://github.com/rootxharsh , https://github.com/iamnoooob, and https://github.com/projectdiscovery", "methods": ["IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability in user update function.", "Update of another user's password without authentication.", "Docker image update to patch vulnerability.", "Docker-compose restart to apply patch.", "Upgrade to a patched version (v0.18.6 or later).", "Pulling the latest docker image of backend as a workaround."]}
