{"description": "Jenkins NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 1.22 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a connection test HTTP endpoint. This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified hostname and port using attacker-specified username and password. Additionally, this HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.\n\nNeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 2.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoint.", "methods": ["Allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified hostname and port using attacker-specified username and password.", "Does not perform a permission check in a connection test HTTP endpoint.", "Allows attackers to exploit a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.", "Requires Overall/Read permission to exploit the vulnerability.", "Requires Overall/Administer permission to be fixed in version 2.2."]}
