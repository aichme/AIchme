{"description": "In Apache Spark versions prior to versions 3.4.0 and 3.3.3, applications using spark-submit can specify a `proxy-user` to run as, limiting privileges. The application can execute code with the privileges of the submitting user, however, by providing malicious configuration-related classes on the classpath. This affects architectures relying on proxy-user, for example those using Apache Livy to manage submitted applications.\n\nUpdate to Apache Spark 3.4.0, 3.3.3, or later, and ensure that spark.submit.proxyUser.allowCustomClasspathInClusterMode is set to its default of \"false\", and is not overridden by submitted applications.", "methods": ["Impersonation: The application can execute code with the privileges of the submitting user.", "Evasion: Malicious configuration-related classes can be provided on the classpath to bypass security restrictions.", "Privilege Escalation: The application can execute code with elevated privileges."]}
