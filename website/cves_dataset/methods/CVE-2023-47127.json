{"description": "> ### CVSS: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:O/RC:C` (4.0)\n\n### Problem\nGiven that there are at least two different sites in the same TYPO3 installation - for instance _first.example.org_ and _second.example.com_ - then a session cookie generated for the first site can be reused on the second site without requiring additional authentication.\n\nThis vulnerability primarily affects the frontend of the website. It's important to note that exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid user account.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 8.7.55 ELTS, 9.5.44 ELTS, 10.4.41 ELTS, 11.5.33, 12.4.8 that fix the problem described above.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to R\u00e9my Daniel who reported this issue, and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2023-006](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2023-006)\n", "methods": ["Exploitation of Weakness in Session Management.", "Use of Valid Accounts for Privilege Escalation.", "Lateral Movement between sites in the same installation."]}
