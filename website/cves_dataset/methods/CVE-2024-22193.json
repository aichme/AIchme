{"description": "### Impact\nThere are no checks on whether the input is encrypted if a task is created in an encrypted collaboration. Therefore, a user may accidentally create a task with sensitive input data that will then be stored unencrypted in a database.\n\n### Workarounds\nThis is not an issue with the normal workflow, only if e.g. a user with the python client sets encryption to the wrong value.", "methods": ["Creates unencrypted tasks in encrypted collaboration.", "Stores sensitive input data in an unencrypted database."]}
