{"description": "Due to how Wire handles type information in its serialization format, malicious payloads can be passed to a deserializer. e.g. using a surrogate on the sender end, an attacker can pass information about a different type for the receiving end. And by doing so allowing the serializer to create any type on the deserializing end.\n\n**This is the same issue that exists for .NET BinaryFormatter https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/ca2300?view=vs-2019**\n\nThis also applies to the fork of Wire, AkkaDotNet/Hyperion.\n\n\n", "methods": ["Insecure deserialization of serialized data.", "Use of surrogate to manipulate type information.", "Creation of arbitrary types on the deserializing end."]}
