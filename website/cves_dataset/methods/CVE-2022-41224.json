{"description": "Jenkins 2.367 through 2.369 (both inclusive) does not escape tooltips of the `l:helpIcon` UI component used for some help icons on the Jenkins web UI, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control tooltips for this component.\n\nAs of publication, the Jenkins security team is unaware of any exploitable help icon/tooltip in Jenkins core or plugins published by the Jenkins project. The vast majority of help icons use the `l:help` component instead of l:helpIcon. The few known instances of `l:helpIcon` do not have user-controllable tooltip contents.", "methods": ["Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the Jenkins web UI, specifically in the `l:helpIcon` component."]}
