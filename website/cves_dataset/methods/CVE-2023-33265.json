{"description": "### Impact\nIn Hazelcast Platform, 5.0 through 5.0.4, 5.1 through 5.1.6, and 5.2 through 5.2.3, and Hazelcast IMDG (all versions up to 4.2.z), Executor Services don't check client permissions properly, allowing authenticated users to execute tasks on members without the required permissions granted.\n\n### Patches\nFix versions: 5.3.0, 5.2.4, 5.1.7, 5.0.5\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers are only affected when they already use executor services (i.e., an instance exists as a distributed data structure).\n\n", "methods": ["Misuse of Privileges", "Lack of Input Validation", "Execution with Elevated Privileges", "Execution of Unauthorized Actions"]}
