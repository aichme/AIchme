{"description": "With the consul ruby gem before 1.0.3, if a controller checks multiple powers  using `:if` or `:except` conditions, these conditions are erroneously applied to all power checks in that controller. This can lead to skipped power checks and hence unauthenticated access to certain controller actions.", "methods": ["Skipped authentication checks for certain controller actions.", "Unauthenticated access to certain controller actions."]}
