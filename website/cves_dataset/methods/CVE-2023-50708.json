{"description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nOriginal Report:\n\n> The Oauth1/2 \"state\" and OpenID Connect \"nonce\" is vulnerable for a \"timing attack\" since it's compared via regular string \n> comparison (instead of `Yii::$app->getSecurity()->compareString()`).\n\nAffected Code:\n\n1. OAuth 1 \"state\"\n\n    https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient/blob/0d1c3880f4d79e20aa1d77c012650b54e69695ff/src/OAuth1.php#L158\n\n3. OAuth 2 \"state\"\n    \n    https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient/blob/0d1c3880f4d79e20aa1d77c012650b54e69695ff/src/OAuth2.php#L121\n\n4. OpenID Connect \"nonce\"\n    \n    https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient/blob/0d1c3880f4d79e20aa1d77c012650b54e69695ff/src/OpenIdConnect.php#L420\n\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nTBD: Replace strcmp with  `Yii::$app->getSecurity()->compareString()`).\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nnot as far as I see.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n", "methods": ["Used timing attack on string comparison in OAuth1, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect implementation.", "Used regular string comparison instead of secure string comparison."]}
