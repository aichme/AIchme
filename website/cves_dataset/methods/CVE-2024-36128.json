{"description": "### Describe the Bug\n\nProviding a non-numeric length value to the random string generation utility will create a memory issue breaking the capability to generate random strings platform wide. This creates a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed as sessions depend on the capability to generate a random session ID.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n1. Test if the endpoint is working and accessible, `GET http://localhost:8055/utils/random/string`\n2. Do a bad request `GET http://localhost:8055/utils/random/string?length=foo`\n3. After this all calls to `GET http://localhost:8055/utils/random/string` will return an empty string instead of a random string\n4. In this error situation you'll see authentication refreshes fail for the app and api.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis counts as an unauthenticated denial of service attack vector so this impacts all unpatched instances reachable over the internet.", "methods": ["Used a denial of service (DoS) attack to break the capability to generate random strings platform wide.", "Created a denial of service situation where logged in sessions can no longer be refreshed.", "Impacted all unpatched instances reachable over the internet."]}
