{"description": "### Impact\nImplementations using this library with directory browsing enabled may be susceptible to [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) attacks.\n\n### Patches\nUsers can upgrade to v4.1.0\n\n### Workarounds\nSet `dir_browser.enable = False` in the configuration. For instance, when using a Python dictionary to configure the library:\n\n```\nconfig = {\n    # your normal configuration\n    \"dir_browser\": {\n      \"enable\": False\n    },\n}\napp = WsgiDAVApp(config)\n```\n\n### For more information\n\nNote that an attacker cannot exploit this vulnerability, by simply  uploading a file or folder with a manipulated file name.\nHowever if the WsgiDAV library is used in a scenario where untrusted data is displayed in the directory browser's user interface (e.g. 'realm' or user name, ...) XSS may happen.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [mar10/wsgidav](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav/)\n* See the [security policy](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav/security/policy)\n", "methods": ["Directory browsing enabled may be susceptible to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.", "Untrusted data displayed in the directory browser's user interface may lead to XSS.", "Uploading a file or folder with a manipulated file name may lead to XSS."]}
