{"description": "Owncast is an open source, self-hosted, decentralized, single user live video streaming and chat server. The Owncast application exposes an administrator API at the URL /api/admin. The emoji/delete endpoint of said API allows administrators to delete custom emojis, which are saved on disk. The parameter name is taken from the JSON request and directly appended to the filepath that points to the emoji to delete. By using path traversal sequences (../), attackers with administrative privileges can exploit this endpoint to delete arbitrary files on the system, outside of the emoji directory. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.1.3.", "methods": ["Used path traversal sequences (../) to delete arbitrary files on the system.", "Leveraged the /api/admin/emoji/delete endpoint to exploit the vulnerability.", "Exploited the Owncast application's administrator API to gain unauthorized access.", "Used the JSON request parameter to manipulate the filepath to the emoji to delete."]}
