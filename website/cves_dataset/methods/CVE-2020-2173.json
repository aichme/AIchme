{"description": "Gatling Plugin 1.2.7 and earlier serves Gatling reports in a manner that bypasses the `Content-Security-Policy` protection introduced in Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3. This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to change report content.\n\nGatling Plugin 1.3.0 no longer allows viewing Gatling reports directly in Jenkins. Instead users need to download an archive containing the report.", "methods": ["Bypassed Content-Security-Policy protection.", "Exploited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.", "Used user input to change report content."]}
