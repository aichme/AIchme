{"description": "When installing a package from a Mercurial VCS URL, e.g. `pip install hg+...`, with pip prior to v23.3, the specified Mercurial revision could be used to inject arbitrary configuration options to the `hg clone` call (e.g. `--config`). Controlling the Mercurial configuration can modify how and which repository is installed. This vulnerability does not affect users who aren't installing from Mercurial.", "methods": ["Used Command Injection to inject arbitrary configuration options to the `hg clone` call.", "Used Command Injection to modify how and which repository is installed."]}
