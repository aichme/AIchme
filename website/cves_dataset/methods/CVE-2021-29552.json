{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a denial of service by controlling the values of `num_segments` tensor argument for `UnsortedSegmentJoin`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninputs = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.string)\nsegment_ids = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.int32)\nnum_segments = tf.constant([], dtype=tf.int32)\nseparator = ''\n\ntf.raw_ops.UnsortedSegmentJoin(\n  inputs=inputs, segment_ids=segment_ids,\n  num_segments=num_segments, separator=separator)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a2a607db15c7cd01d754d37e5448d72a13491bdb/tensorflow/core/kernels/unsorted_segment_join_op.cc#L92-L93) assumes that the `num_segments` tensor is a valid scalar:\n\n```cc\nconst Tensor& num_segments_tensor = context->input(2);\nauto num_segments = num_segments_tensor.scalar<NUM_SEGMENTS_TYPE>()();\n```\n\nSince the tensor is empty the `CHECK` involved in `.scalar<T>()()` that checks that the number of elements is exactly 1 will be invalidated and this would result in process termination.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [704866eabe03a9aeda044ec91a8d0c83fc1ebdbe](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/704866eabe03a9aeda044ec91a8d0c83fc1ebdbe).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Used a CHECK-failure in `UnsortedSegmentJoin` to cause a denial of service.", "Exploited an implementation assumption in the `UnsortedSegmentJoin` function.", "Invalidated a CHECK involved in `.scalar<T>()()` to cause process termination."]}
