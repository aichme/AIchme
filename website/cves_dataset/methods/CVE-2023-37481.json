{"description": "### Impact\nThe Fides webserver is vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to upload zip files containing malicious SVG bombs (similar to a billion laughs attack), causing resource exhaustion in Admin UI browser tabs and creating a persistent denial of service of the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`).\n\nThis vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`. Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and users with the owner role.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Fides version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no known workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading.", "methods": ["Used a file upload vulnerability to upload malicious SVG files.", "Exploited a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability to cause resource exhaustion.", "Used a zip file containing malicious SVG bombs to cause a persistent DoS.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the Admin UI browser tabs.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the 'new connector' page (`datastore-connection/new`)."]}
