{"description": "### Impact\nRequests to an OpenSearch cluster configured with advanced access control features ([document level security (DLS)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security-plugin/access-control/document-level-security/), [field level security (FLS)](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security-plugin/access-control/field-level-security/), and/or [field masking](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security-plugin/access-control/field-masking/)) will not be filtered when the query's search pattern matches an aliased index.\n\nOpenSearch Dashboards creates an alias to `.kibana` by default, so filters with the index pattern of `*` to restrict access to documents or fields will not be applied.\n\nThis issue allows requests to access sensitive information when customer have acted to restrict access that specific information. \n\n### Patches\nOpenSearch 2.2.0+ contains the fix for this issue. OpenSearch Security Plugin 2.2.0.0 is compatible with OpenSearch 2.2.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no recommended work around.\n\n### References\nSee pull request #1999 for additional details.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory we ask that contact AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/) or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com.
