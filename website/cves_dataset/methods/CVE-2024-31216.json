{"description": "### Impact\n\nWhen source-controller is configured to use an [Azure SAS token](https://v2-2.docs.fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/#azure-blob-sas-token-example) when connecting to Azure Blob Storage, the token was logged along with the Azure URL when the controller encountered a connection error. An attacker with access to the source-controller logs could use the token to gain access to the Azure Blob Storage until the token expires.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability was fixed in source-controller **v1.2.5**.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround for this vulnerability except for using a different auth mechanism such as [Azure Workload Identity](https://v2-2.docs.fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/#azure). \n\n### Credits\n\nThis issue was reported and fixed by Jagpreet Singh Tamber (@jagpreetstamber) from the Azure Arc team.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/pull/1430\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open an issue in the source-controller repository.\n- Contact us at the CNCF Flux Channel.\n", "methods": ["Leaked sensitive information (Azure SAS token) into logs.", "Used a vulnerable version of source-controller (v1.2.4 and below).", "Used an insecure authentication mechanism (Azure SAS token)."]}
