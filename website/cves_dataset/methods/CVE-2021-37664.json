{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can read from outside of bounds of heap allocated data by sending specially crafted illegal arguments to `BoostedTreesSparseCalculateBestFeatureSplit`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesSparseCalculateBestFeatureSplit(\n  node_id_range=[0,10],\n  stats_summary_indices=[[1, 2, 3, 0x1000000]],\n  stats_summary_values=[1.0],\n  stats_summary_shape=[1,1,1,1],\n  l1=l2=[1.0],\n  tree_complexity=[0.5],\n  min_node_weight=[1.0],\n  logits_dimension=3,\n  split_type='inequality')                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/84d053187cb80d975ef2b9684d4b61981bca0c41/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/stats_ops.cc) needs to validate that each value in `stats_summary_indices` is in range.\n  \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e84c975313e8e8e38bb2ea118196369c45c51378](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e84c975313e8e8e38bb2ea118196369c45c51378).\n  \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n  \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB (Out of Bounds) in Boosted Trees SparseCalculateBestFeatureSplit function.", "Sending specially crafted illegal arguments to a function.", "Failing to validate input values in range."]}
