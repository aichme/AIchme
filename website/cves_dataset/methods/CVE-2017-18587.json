{"description": "Serializing of headers to the socket did not filter the values for newline bytes (\\r or \\n), which allowed for header values to split a request or response. People would not likely include newlines in the headers in their own applications, so the way for most people to exploit this is if an application constructs headers based on unsanitized user input.\n\nThis issue was fixed by replacing all newline characters with a space during serialization of a header value.", "methods": ["Used unsanitized user input to construct headers.", "Failed to filter newline bytes (\\r or \\n) from header values.", "Serialized headers to the socket without sanitizing newline characters.", "Replaced newline characters with a space during serialization of a header value to fix the issue."]}
