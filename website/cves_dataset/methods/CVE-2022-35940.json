{"description": "### Impact\nThe [`RaggedRangOp`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/0b6b491d21d6a4eb5fbab1cca565bc1e94ca9543/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_range_op.cc#L74-L88) function takes an argument `limits` that is eventually used to construct a `TensorShape` as an `int64`. If `limits` is a very large float, it can overflow when converted to an `int64`. This triggers an `InvalidArgument` but also throws an abort signal that crashes the program.\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.RaggedRange(starts=[1.1,0.1],limits=[10.0,1e20],deltas=[1,1])\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [37cefa91bee4eace55715eeef43720b958a01192](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/37cefa91bee4eace55715eeef43720b958a01192).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Jingyi Shi.", "methods": ["None."]}
