{"description": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) may allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of the victim\u2019s browser. This may lead to unauthorised actions being performed, unauthorised access to data, stealing of session information, denial of service, etc. An attacker needs to coerce a user into visiting a link with the XSS payload to be properly exploited against a victim.\n\nThe OpenCart Overclocked OpenBay template overly trusts user-controlled input. This lack of sufficient sanitisation allows an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the context of a victim\u2019s browser.\n\nThe code below displays unsanitised input being displayed on the victim\u2019s page (found on line 95 [upload/admin/view/template/extension/openbay.tpl#L95](https://github.com/villagedefrance/OpenCart-Overclocked/blob/2f98e839f84beb0ed8dd11d7c0f6eb1501d44969/upload/admin/view/template/extension/openbay.tpl#L95)):\n\n```php\nvar token = \"<?php echo $_GET['token']; ?>\"; \n```", "methods": ["Used Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to execute JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.", "Exploited lack of input sanitization in OpenCart Overclocked OpenBay template.", "Coerced a user into visiting a link with the XSS payload to be exploited.", "Executed JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser."]}
