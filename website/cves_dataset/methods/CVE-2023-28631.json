{"description": "### Impact\nA Comrak AST can be constructed manually by a program instead of parsing a Markdown document with `parse_document`. This AST can then be converted to HTML via `html::format_document_with_plugins`. However, the HTML formatting code assumes that the AST is well-formed. For example, many AST notes contain `[u8]` fields which the formatting code assumes is valid UTF-8 data. Several bugs can be triggered if this is not the case.\n\n### Patches\n\n0.17.0 contains adjustments to the AST, storing strings instead of unvalidated byte arrays.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Validate UTF-8 correctness of all data when assigning to `&[u8]` and `Vec<u8>` fields in the AST.\n\n### References\nn/a", "methods": ["Constructed a Comrak AST manually instead of parsing a Markdown document.", "Failed to validate AST node data.", "Failed to validate UTF-8 correctness of data when assigning to `[u8]` and `Vec<u8>` fields in the AST."]}
