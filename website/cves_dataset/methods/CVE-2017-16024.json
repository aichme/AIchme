{"description": "Affected versions of `sync-exec` use files located in `/tmp/` to buffer command results before returning values. As `/tmp/` is almost always set with world readable permissions, this may allow low privilege users on the system to read the results of commands run via `sync-exec` under a higher privilege user.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThere is currently no direct patch for `sync-exec`, as the `child_process.execSync` function provided in Node.js v0.12.0 and later provides the same functionality natively. \n\nThe best mitigation currently is to update to Node.js v0.12.0 or later, and migrate all uses of `sync-exec` to `child_process.execSync()`.", "methods": ["Creates temporary files in /tmp/ with world-readable permissions.", "Uses a vulnerable version of `sync-exec` to execute commands.", "Allows low-privilege users to read command results from higher-privilege users."]}
