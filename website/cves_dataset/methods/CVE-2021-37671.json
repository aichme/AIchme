{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.Map*` and `tf.raw_ops.OrderedMap*` operations:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \ntf.raw_ops.MapPeek(\n  key=tf.constant([8],dtype=tf.int64),\n  indices=[],\n  dtypes=[tf.int32],\n  capacity=8,\n  memory_limit=128)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/kernels/map_stage_op.cc#L222-L248) has a check in place to ensure that `indices` is in ascending order, but does not check that `indices` is not empty.\n    \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [532f5c5a547126c634fefd43bbad1dc6417678ac](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/532f5c5a547126c634fefd43bbad1dc6417678ac).\n                       \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n    \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["None"]}
