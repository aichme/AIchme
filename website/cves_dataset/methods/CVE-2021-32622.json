{"description": "Matrix-React-SDK is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip client into a web page. Before version 3.21.0, when uploading a file, the local file preview can lead to execution of scripts embedded in the uploaded file. This can only occur after several user interactions to open the preview in a separate tab. This only impacts the local user while in the process of uploading. It cannot be exploited remotely or by other users. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.21.0.", "methods": ["Used improper file handling to execute scripts embedded in uploaded files.", "Executed scripts after several user interactions to open the file preview in a separate tab.", "Exploited the vulnerability locally, impacting the user during the file upload process."]}
