{"description": "Affected versions of this crate caused traps and/or memory unsafety by zero-initializing references. They also could lead to uninitialized memory being dropped if the field for which the offset is requested was behind a deref coercion, and that deref coercion caused a panic. The flaw was corrected by using MaybeUninit.", "methods": ["Exposed uninitialized memory in memoffset.", "Used zero-initializing references.", "Dropped uninitialized memory.", "Caused memory unsafety.", "Trapped due to deref coercion.", "Used MaybeUninit to correct the flaw."]}
