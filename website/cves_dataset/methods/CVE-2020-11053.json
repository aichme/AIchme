{"description": "### Impact\nAs users can provide a redirect address for the proxy to send the authenticated user to at the end of the authentication flow. This is expected to be the original URL that the user was trying to access.\nThis redirect URL is checked within the proxy and validated before redirecting the user to prevent malicious actors providing redirects to potentially harmful sites.\n\nHowever, by crafting a redirect URL with HTML encoded whitespace characters (eg. `%0a`, `%0b`,`%09`,`%0d`) the validation could be bypassed and allow a redirect to any URL provided.\n\n### Patches\n@rootxharsh and @iamnoooob provided this patch as potential solution:\n```\nFrom 4b941f56eda310b5c4dc8080b7635a6bfabccad4 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001\nFrom: Harsh Jaiswal <harsh@pop-os.localdomain>\nDate: Fri, 1 May 2020 20:38:31 +0530\nSubject: [PATCH] Fixes redirect issue\n\n---\n oauthproxy.go | 3 ++-\n 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)\n\ndiff --git a/oauthproxy.go b/oauthproxy.go\nindex 1e9bb7c..f8beb4d 100644\n--- a/oauthproxy.go\n+++ b/oauthproxy.go\n@@ -577,8 +577,9 @@ func validOptionalPort(port string) bool {\n\n // IsValidRedirect checks whether the redirect URL is whitelisted\n func (p *OAuthProxy) IsValidRedirect(redirect string) bool {\n+       matched, _ := regexp.MatchString(`^/\\s+/|\\\\`, redirect)\n        switch {\n-       case strings.HasPrefix(redirect, \"/\") && !strings.HasPrefix(redirect, \"//\") && !strings.HasPrefix(redirect, \"/\\\\\"):\n+       case strings.HasPrefix(redirect, \"/\") && !strings.HasPrefix(redirect, \"//\") && !matched:\n                return true\n        case strings.HasPrefix(redirect, \"http://\") || strings.HasPrefix(redirect, \"https://\"):\n                redirectURL, err := url.Parse(redirect)\n--\n2.17.1\n```\n\nThis issue was also reported to us separately by @mik317 several hours later\n\nThe fix was implemented in [#xxx]() and released as version 5.1.1", "methods": ["Used HTML encoded whitespace characters to bypass validation.", "Used crafted redirect URL to redirect to any URL provided.", "Implemented patch to fix redirect issue by adding validation for HTML encoded whitespace characters."]}
