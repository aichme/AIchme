{"description": "### Impact\nNVFLARE contains a vulnerability where deserialization of Untrusted Data due to Pickle usage may allow an unprivileged network attacker to cause Remote Code Execution, Denial Of Service, and Impact to both Confidentiality and Integrity. \n\nAll versions before 2.1.4 are affected. \n\nCVSS Score = 9.8 \n \n[AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) \n\n\n### Patches\n \nThe patch is included in nvflare==2.1.4 \nThis new version uses MessagePack instead of Pickle to do serialization and deserialization.  \n\nSome object serializations supported by Pickle are not supported by MessagePack. We have provided out of box support for some built-in NVFLARE objects. For object serializations unsupported by MessagePack, the user will need to convert the objects to numpy or bytes before sending over to remote machines.  The list of supported object types are listed in https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare/blob/2.1/nvflare/fuel/utils/fobs/README.rst \n\n \n### Workarounds\n\nNo workarounds available. \n \n### Additional information \nIssue Found by: Oliver Sellwood (Nintorac) and Elias Hohl\n\n", "methods": ["Deserialization of Untrusted Data due to Pickle usage.", "Remote Code Execution.", "Denial Of Service.", "Impact to Confidentiality.", "Impact to Integrity."]}
