{"description": "Medialize is a Javascript URL mutation library. When parsing a URL without a scheme and with excessive slashes, like ///www.example.com, URI.js will parse the hostname as null and the path as /www.example.com. Such behaviour is different from that exhibited by browsers, which will parse ///www.example.com as http://www.example.com instead. For example, the following will cause a redirect to http://www.example.com: A fix was released in version 1.19.11.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in a library (Medialize URI.js) to manipulate URLs.", "Exploited a difference in URL parsing behavior between the library and browsers.", "Leveraged a version of the library with a known vulnerability (prior to 1.19.11)."]}
