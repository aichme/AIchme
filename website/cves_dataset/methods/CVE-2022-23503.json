{"description": "### Problem\nDue to the lack of separating user-submitted data from the internal configuration in the Form Designer backend module, it was possible to inject code instructions to be processed and executed via TypoScript as PHP code.\n\nThe existence of individual TypoScript instructions for a particular form item (known as [`formDefinitionOverrides`](https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-form/main/en-us/I/Concepts/FrontendRendering/Index.html#form-element-properties)) and a valid backend user account with access to the form module are needed to exploit this vulnerability.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 8.7.49 ELTS, 9.5.38 ELTS, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, 12.1.1 that fix the problem described above.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-015](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-015)\n", "methods": ["Injected code instructions via TypoScript as PHP code.", "Executed arbitrary code via Form Designer backend module.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the Form Framework of TYPO3 CMS."]}
