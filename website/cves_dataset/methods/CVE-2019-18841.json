The package fails to prevent modification of object prototypes through chart options containing a payload such as `{\"__proto__\": {\"polluted\": true}}`. It is possible to achieve the same results if a chart loads data from a malicious server.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 3.2.0 or later.", "methods": ["Manipulated object prototypes through chart options.", "Loaded data from a malicious server."]}
