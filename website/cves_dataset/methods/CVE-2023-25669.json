{"description": "### Impact\nIf the stride and window size are not positive for `tf.raw_ops.AvgPoolGrad`, it can give an FPE.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n\n@tf.function(jit_compile=True)\ndef test():\n   y = tf.raw_ops.AvgPoolGrad(orig_input_shape=[1,0,0,0], grad=[[[[0.39117979]]]], ksize=[1,0,0,0], strides=[1,0,0,0], padding=\"SAME\", data_format=\"NCHW\")\n   return y\n\nprint(test())\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1295ae4dbb52fe06b19733b0257e2340d7b63b8d](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1295ae4dbb52fe06b19733b0257e2340d7b63b8d).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by r3pwnx of 360 AIVul Team\n", "methods": ["None"]}
