{"description": "### Problem\nThe TYPO3-specific [`t3://` URI scheme](https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/main/en-us/Functions/Typolink.html#resource-references) could be used to access resources outside of the users' permission scope. This encompassed files, folders, pages, and records (although only if a valid link-handling configuration was provided). Exploiting this vulnerability requires a valid backend user account.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 8.7.57 ELTS, 9.5.46 ELTS, 10.4.43 ELTS, 11.5.35 LTS, 12.4.11 LTS, 13.0.1 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Richie Lee who reported this issue and to TYPO3 core & security team member Benjamin Franzke who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2024-005](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2024-005)\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable TYPO3-specific URI scheme to access resources outside of the users' permission scope.", "Exploited a valid backend user account to access unauthorized resources.", "Used a valid link-handling configuration to access files, folders, pages, and records."]}
