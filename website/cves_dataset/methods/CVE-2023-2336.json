{"description": "### Impact\nAn authenticated attacker can abuse import-server-files with a path traversal to download an arbitrary file from the server\n\nAn arbitrary file read vulnerability allows an attacker to read files on the server that they should not have access to, potentially including sensitive files such as configuration files, user data, and credentials. This can result in the exposure of confidential information, which can be used to launch further attacks or compromise the system.\n\n### Patches\nUpdate to version 10.5.21 or apply this patch manually https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/498cadec2292f7842fb10612068ac78496e884b4.patch\n\n### Workarounds\nApply patch https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/498cadec2292f7842fb10612068ac78496e884b4.patch manually.\n\n### References\nhttps://huntr.dev/bounties/af764624-7746-4f53-8480-85348dbb4f14/\n", "methods": ["Used path traversal to download an arbitrary file from the server.", "Read files on the server that the attacker should not have access to.", "Exposed confidential information, including configuration files, user data, and credentials."]}
