{"description": "### Summary\n\nThe bearertokenauth extension's server authenticator performs a simple, non-constant time string comparison of the received & configured bearer tokens.\n\n### Details\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/9128a9258fe1fee36f198f97b1e3371fc7b77a93/extension/bearertokenauthextension/bearertokenauth.go#L189-L196\n\nFor background on the type of vulnerability, see https://ropesec.com/articles/timing-attacks/.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis impacts anyone using the `bearertokenauth` server authenticator. Malicious clients with network access to the collector may perform a timing attack against a collector with this authenticator to guess the configured token, by iteratively sending tokens and comparing the response time. This would allow an attacker to introduce fabricated or bad data into the collector's telemetry pipeline.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe observable timing vulnerability was fixed by @axw in v0.107.0 (PR https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/pull/34516) by using constant-time comparison.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- upgrade to v0.107.0 or above, or, if you're unable to upgrade at this time,\n- don't expose the receiver using `bearertokenauth` to network segments accessible by potential attackers, or\n- change the receiver to use a different authentication extension instead, or\n- disable the receiver relying on `bearertokenauth`", "methods": ["Used timing attacks to guess the configured token.", "Used network access to the collector to perform a timing attack.", "Used iterative token sending to compare response time.", "Used fabricated or bad data to introduce into the collector's telemetry pipeline.", "Used constant-time comparison to fix the timing vulnerability.", "Used a different authentication extension instead of bearertokenauth.", "Used network segments accessible by potential attackers to expose the receiver.", "Used upgrade to v0.107.0 or above to fix the vulnerability."]}
