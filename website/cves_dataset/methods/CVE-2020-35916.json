{"description": "A mutable reference to a struct was constructed by dereferencing a pointer obtained from slice::as_ptr. Instead, slice::as_mut_ptr should have been called on the mutable slice argument. The former performs an implicit reborrow as an immutable shared reference which does not allow writing through the derived pointer.", "methods": ["Used a pointer to an immutable reference to a struct.", "Failed to use a mutable reference to a struct."]}
