{"description": "Redcarpet is a Ruby library for Markdown processing. In Redcarpet before version 3.5.1, there is an injection vulnerability which can enable a cross-site scripting attack. In affected versions no HTML escaping was being performed when processing quotes. This applies even when the `:escape_html` option was being used.  This is fixed in version 3.5.1 by the referenced commit.", "methods": ["Injects malicious code via a Ruby library for Markdown processing.", "Uses a vulnerability in a Ruby library to enable a cross-site scripting attack.", "Fails to perform HTML escaping when processing quotes."]}
