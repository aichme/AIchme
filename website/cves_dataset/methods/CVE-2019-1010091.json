{"description": "### Impact\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in: the core parser and `media` plugin. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor via the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 4.9.9 or lower and TinyMCE 5.2.1 or lower.\n\n### Patches\nThis vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 4.9.10 and 5.2.2 by improved HTML parsing and sanitization logic.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe workarounds available are:\n- disable the media plugin and manually sanitize CDATA content (see below)\nor\n- upgrade to either TinyMCE 4.9.10 or TinyMCE 5.2.2\n\n#### Example: Manually strip CDATA elements\n```js\nsetup: function(editor) {\n  editor.on('PreInit', function() {\n    editor.parser.addNodeFilter('#cdata', function(nodes) {\n      for (var i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {\n        nodes[i].remove();\n      }\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\nTiny Technologies would like to thank Micha\u0142 Bentkowski and [intivesec](https://github.com/intivesec) for discovering these vulnerabilities.\n\n### References\nhttps://www.tiny.cloud/docs/release-notes/release-notes522/#securityfixes\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [TinyMCE repo](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce/issues)\n* Email us at [infosec@tiny.cloud](mailto:infosec@tiny.cloud)", "methods": ["Used cross-site scripting (XSS) to execute arbitrary JavaScript.", "Used clipboard to insert specially crafted content into the editor.", "Used APIs to insert specially crafted content into the editor.", "Used HTML parsing and sanitization logic to improve security.", "Used manual sanitization of CDATA content to prevent XSS.", "Used manual removal of CDATA elements to prevent XSS."]}
