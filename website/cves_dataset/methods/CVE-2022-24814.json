{"description": "### Impact\n\nUnauthorized JavaScript can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis was resolved in https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/12020 which is released in 9.7.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\nYou can disable the live embed in the WYSIWYG by adding `{ \"media_live_embeds\": false }` to the _Options Overrides_ option of the Rich Text HTML interface.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/directus/directus/pull/12020\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [directus/directus](https://github.com/directus/directus)\n* Email us at [security@directus.io](mailto:security@directus.io)\n", "methods": ["Used Cross-site Scripting (XSS) to execute unauthorized JavaScript.", "Injected an iframe into the rich text html interface to load an uploaded JS file.", "Loaded an uploaded HTML file that linked to another uploaded JS file.", "Bypassed the Content Security Policy (CSP) header.", "Used the Rich Text HTML interface to inject malicious code.", "Used the WYSIWYG editor to inject malicious code."]}
