{"description": "### Impact\nApps using both `contextIsolation` and `sandbox: true` are affected.\nApps using both `contextIsolation` and `nativeWindowOpen: true` are affected.\n\nThis is a context isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and perform privileged actions.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no app-side workarounds, you must update your Electron version to be protected.\n\n### Fixed Versions\n* `11.0.0-beta.6`\n* `10.1.2`\n* `9.3.1`\n* `8.5.2`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [security@electronjs.org](mailto:security@electronjs.org)", "methods": ["Used context isolation bypass in Electron to reach into the isolated context and perform privileged actions.", "Used Electron contextIsolation and sandbox: true to bypass context isolation.", "Used Electron contextIsolation and nativeWindowOpen: true to bypass context isolation.", "Updated Electron version to be protected (patching)."]}
