{"description": "### Impact\nA specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB write on heap in the TFLite implementation of [`ArgMin`/`ArgMax`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/arg_min_max.cc#L52-L59):\n\n```cc\nTfLiteIntArray* output_dims = TfLiteIntArrayCreate(NumDimensions(input) - 1);\nint j = 0;\nfor (int i = 0; i < NumDimensions(input); ++i) { \n  if (i != axis_value) {\n    output_dims->data[j] = SizeOfDimension(input, i);\n    ++j;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the condition in the `if` is never true, so code writes past the last valid element of `output_dims->data`.\n  \n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB write in TFLite implementation of ArgMin/ArgMax.", "Used specially crafted TFLite model to trigger the OOB write."]}
