{"description": "Affected versions of this crate contained a bug in which decoding untrusted input could overflow the stack. On architectures with stack probes (like x86), this can be used for denial of service attacks, while on architectures without stack probes (like ARM) overflowing the stack is unsound and can result in potential memory corruption (or even RCE).", "methods": ["Used out-of-bounds write to cause denial of service attacks on x86 architectures.", "Used out-of-bounds write to cause memory corruption on ARM architectures.", "Used out-of-bounds write to potentially cause remote code execution on ARM architectures."]}
