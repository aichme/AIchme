{"description": "JHipster generator-jhipster before 2.23.0 allows a timing attack against validateToken due to a string comparison that stops at the first character that is different. Attackers can guess tokens by brute forcing one character at a time and observing the timing. This of course drastically reduces the search space to a linear amount of guesses based on the token length times the possible characters.", "methods": ["Allows a timing attack against validateToken due to a string comparison that stops at the first character that is different.", "Brute force guessing of tokens one character at a time.", "Observing timing to determine token character differences."]}
