{"description": "\"This affects all versions of package com.mintegral.msdk:alphab. The Android SDK distributed by the company contains malicious functionality in this module that tracks: 1. Downloads from Google urls either within Google apps or via browser including file downloads, e-mail attachments and Google Docs links. 2. All apk downloads, either organic or not. Mintegral listens to download events in Android's download manager and detects if the downloaded file's url contains: a. google.com or comes from a Google app (the com.android.vending package) b. Ends with .apk for apk downloads In both cases, the module sends the captured data back to Mintegral's servers. Note that the malicious functionality keeps running even if the app is currently not in focus (running in the background).\"", "methods": ["Tracks downloads from Google URLs, including file downloads, email attachments, and Google Docs links.", "Tracks all APK downloads, organic or not.", "Listens to download events in Android's download manager.", "Detects downloads from Google apps (com.android.vending package).", "Detects downloads with URLs containing \"google.com\".", "Detects downloads with file extensions \".apk\".", "Sends captured data back to Mintegral's servers.", "Runs in the background, even when the app is not in focus."]}
