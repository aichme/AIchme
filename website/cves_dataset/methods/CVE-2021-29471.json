{"description": "### Impact\n\n\"Push rules\" can specify [conditions](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.1#conditions) under which they will match, including `event_match`, which matches event content against a pattern including wildcards.\n\nCertain patterns can cause very poor performance in the matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing moderate length events.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is patched by https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/commit/03318a766cac9f8b053db2214d9c332a977d226c.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA potential workaround might be to prevent users from making custom push rules, by blocking such requests at a reverse-proxy.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at security@matrix.org.", "methods": ["Used push rules with poor performance patterns to cause denial-of-service.", "Used event_match to match event content against a pattern including wildcards.", "Used custom push rules to cause denial-of-service when processing moderate length events."]}
