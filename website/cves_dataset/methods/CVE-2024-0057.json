{"description": "### Description\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 and .NET 8.0. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability. \n\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic. \n\n### Affected software\n#### NuGet & NuGet Packages\n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.8.0 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.7.0 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.6.1 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.4.2 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.3.3 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 6.0.5 version or earlier. \n- Any NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.Packaging 5.11.5 version or earlier. \n\n#### .NET SDK(s)\n- Any .NET SDK 6.0.126 or earlier, or 6.0.418 or earlier.\n- Any .NET SDK 7.0.115 or earlier, or 7.0.312 or earlier, or 7.0.405 or earlier.\n- Any .NET SDK 8.0.101 or earlier.\n \n### Patches\nTo fix the issue, please install the latest version of .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0 and NuGet (NuGet.exe, NuGet.CommandLine, NuGet.
