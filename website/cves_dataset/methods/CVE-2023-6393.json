{"description": "A flaw was found in the Quarkus Cache Runtime. When request processing utilizes a Uni cached using @CacheResult and the cached Uni reuses the initial \"completion\" context, the processing switches to the cached Uni instead of the request context. This is a problem if the cached Uni context contains sensitive information, and could allow a malicious user to benefit from a POST request returning the response that is meant for another user, gaining access to sensitive data.", "methods": ["Exposes sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.", "Allows a malicious user to benefit from a POST request intended for another user.", "Gains access to sensitive data."]}
