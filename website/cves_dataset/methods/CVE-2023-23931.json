{"description": "Previously, `Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers:\n\n```pycon\n>>> outbuf = b\"\\x00\" * 32\n>>> c = ciphers.Cipher(AES(b\"\\x00\" * 32), modes.ECB()).encryptor()\n>>> c.update_into(b\"\\x00\" * 16, outbuf)\n16\n>>> outbuf\nb'\\xdc\\x95\\xc0x\\xa2@\\x89\\x89\\xadH\\xa2\\x14\\x92\\x84 \\x87\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00'\n```\n\nThis would allow immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating fundamental rules of Python. This is a soundness bug -- it allows programmers to misuse an API, it cannot be exploited by attacker controlled data alone.\n\nThis now correctly raises an exception.\n\nThis issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.", "methods": ["Used a soundness bug in the `Cipher.update_into` method to corrupt memory.", "Used an immutable Python object as the outbuf to bypass buffer protocol checks."]}
