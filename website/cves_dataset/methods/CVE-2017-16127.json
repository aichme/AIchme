All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer.\n\nThe package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.", "methods": ["Added itself to the package.json of other packages.", "Published malicious packages to the npm registry.", "Installed malicious packages on the victim host.", "Compromised the victim host, potentially giving full control to an outside entity."]}
