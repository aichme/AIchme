{"description": "### Impact\n\nA self Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability exists in the @github/paste-markdown library. If the clipboard data contains the string `<table>`, a **div** is dynamically created, and the clipboard content is copied into its **innerHTML** property without any sanitization, resulting in improper execution of JavaScript in the browser of the victim (the user who pasted the code). Users directed to copy text from a malicious website and paste it into pages that utilize this library are affected.\n\nThe following @github/paste-markdown code snippet is triggered when the user pastes something and the browser's clipboard data contains an entry whose content-type is **text/HTML**.\n\n```typescript\nfunction generateText(transfer: DataTransfer): string | undefined {\n  if (Array.from(transfer.types).indexOf('text/html') === -1) return\n\n  let html = transfer.getData('text/html')\n  if (!/<table/i.test(html)) return\n\n  html = html.replace(/<meta.*?>/, '')\n\n  const el = document.createElement('div')\n  el.innerHTML = html\n  const tables = el.querySelectorAll('table')\n\n  for (const table of tables) {\n    if (table.closest('[data-paste-markdown-skip]')) {\n      table.replaceWith(new Text(table.textContent || ''))\n    }\n    const formattedTable = tableMarkdown(table)\n    table.replaceWith(new Text(formattedTable))\n  }\n\n  return el.innerHTML\n}\n```\n\n### Patches\nA security patch was released in [version 0.3.4](https://github.com/github/paste-markdown/releases/tag/v0.3.4).\n\n### Workarounds\nA Content Security Policy that prevents `unsafe-inline` helps reduce the likelihood of this vulnerability being exploited in modern browsers.\n\n<!--\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [example link to repo](http://example.com)\n* Email us at [example email address](mailto:example@example.com)\n*\n-->\n", "methods": ["Uses a vulnerability in the @github/paste-markdown library to execute JavaScript in the browser.", "Uses clipboard data to inject malicious code.", "Uses a Content Security Policy to bypass security restrictions.", "Uses a security patch to fix the vulnerability.", "Uses a workaround to prevent exploitation in modern browsers."]}
