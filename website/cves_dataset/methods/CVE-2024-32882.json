{"description": "### Impact\nIf a model has been made available for editing through the [`wagtail.contrib.settings`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/settings.html) module or [`ModelViewSet`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/extending/generic_views.html#modelviewset), and the [`permission` argument on `FieldPanel`](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/pages/panels.html#wagtail.admin.panels.FieldPanel.permission) has been used to further restrict access to one or more fields of the model, a user with edit permission over the model but not the specific field can craft an HTTP POST request that bypasses the permission check on the individual field, allowing them to update its value.\n\nThe vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin, or by a user who has not been granted edit access to the model in question. The editing interfaces for pages and snippets are also unaffected.\n\n### Patches\nPatched versions have been released as Wagtail 6.0.3 and 6.1. Wagtail releases prior to 6.0 are unaffected.\n\n### Workarounds\nSite owners who are unable to upgrade to a patched version can avoid the vulnerability in `ModelViewSet` by registering the model as a snippet instead. No workaround is available for `wagtail.contrib.settings`.\n\n### Acknowledgements\nMany thanks to Ben Morse and Joshua Munn for reporting this issue.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Visit Wagtail's [support channels](https://docs.wagtail.io/en/stable/support.html)\n* Email us at [security@wagtail.org](mailto:security@wagtail.org) (view our [security policy](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/security/policy) for more information).", "methods": ["Bypasses permission checks on individual fields of a model through HTTP POST requests.", "Exploits permission check bypass in Wagtail admin interface.", "Uses HTTP POST requests to update field values without permission."]}
