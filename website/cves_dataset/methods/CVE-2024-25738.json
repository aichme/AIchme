{"description": "A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the /Upgrade/FixConfig route in Open Library Foundation VuFind 2.0 through 9.1 before 9.1.1 allows a remote attacker to overwrite local configuration files to gain access to the administrator panel and achieve Remote Code Execution. A mitigating factor is that it requires the allow_url_include PHP runtime setting to be on, which is off in default installations. It also requires the /Upgrade route to be exposed, which is exposed by default after installing VuFind, and is recommended to be disabled by setting autoConfigure to false in config.ini.", "methods": ["Used Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) to overwrite local configuration files.", "Achieved Remote Code Execution.", "Required allow_url_include PHP runtime setting to be on.", "Required /Upgrade route to be exposed.", "Used the /Upgrade/FixConfig route.", "Required autoConfigure to be set to false in config.ini."]}
