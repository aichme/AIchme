Delete the package\n2. Clear your npm cache\n3. Ensure it is not present in any other package.json files on your system\n4. Regenerate your SSH keys, registry credentials, tokens, and any other sensitive credentials that may have been present in your bash history.\n\nAdditionally, any service which may have been exposed via credentials in your bash history or accessible via your ssh keys, such as a database, should be reviewed for indicators of compromise as well.", "methods": ["Used a package manager (npm) to install malware (coffescript).", "Stole sensitive data (SSH key and bash history).", "Sent stolen data to attacker-controlled locations.", "Used credentials (SSH keys, registry credentials, tokens) for unauthorized access.", "Used credentials to access a database.", "Executed malicious code via a package manager (npm)."]}
