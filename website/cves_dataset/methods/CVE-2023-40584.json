{"description": "### Impact\nAll versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack vector. Specifically, the said component extracts a user-controlled tar.gz file without validating the size of its inner files. As a result, a malicious, low-privileged user can send a malicious tar.gz file that exploits this vulnerability to the repo-server, thereby harming the system's functionality and availability. Additionally, the repo-server is susceptible to another vulnerability due to the fact that it does not check the extracted file permissions before attempting to delete them. Consequently, an attacker can craft a malicious tar.gz archive in a way that prevents the deletion of its inner files when the manifest generation process is completed.\n\n\n### Patches\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.6.15\n* v2.7.14\n* v2.8.3\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only way to completely resolve the issue is to upgrade.\n\n#### Mitigations\nConfigure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and provide access for configuring applications only to a limited number of administrators. These administrators should utilize trusted and verified Helm charts.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n\n### Credits\nThis vulnerability was found & reported by GE Vernova \u2013 Amit Laish.\n\nThe Argo team would like to thank these contributors for their responsible disclosure and constructive communications during the resolve of this issue\n", "methods": ["Used a Denial of Service (DoS) attack vector.", "Extracted a user-controlled tar.gz file without validating the size of its inner files.", "Failed to check extracted file permissions before attempting to delete them.", "Crafted a malicious tar.gz archive to prevent deletion of its inner files.", "Sent a malicious tar.gz file to the repo-server."]}
