{"description": "Hyper is an HTTP library for Rust and h2 is an HTTP 2.0 client & server implementation for Rust. An issue was discovered in h2 v0.2.4 when processing header frames. It incorrectly processes the HTTP2 `RST_STREAM` frames by not always releasing the memory immediately upon receiving the reset frame, leading to stream stacking. As a result, the memory and CPU usage are high which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS).\n\nThis issue affects users only when dealing with http2 connections.", "methods": ["Uses HTTP2 protocol to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.", "Exploits a vulnerability in the HTTP2 protocol to cause high memory and CPU usage."]}
