{"description": "### Impact\nPossible remote Denial of Service or Data Injection.\n\n### Patches\nPatches are available in https://github.com/horazont/aioxmpp/pull/268. They have been backported to the 0.10 release series and 0.10.3 is the first release to contain the fix.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo make the bug exploitable, an error suppressing ``xso_error_handler`` is required. By not using ``xso_error_handlers`` or not using the suppression function, the vulnerability can be mitigated completely (to our knowledge).\n\n### References\nThe pull request contains a detailed description: https://github.com/horazont/aioxmpp/pull/268\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* [Join our chat](xmpp:aioxmpp@conference.zombofant.net?join)\n* Email the maintainer [Jonas Sch\u00e4fer](mailto:jonas@wielicki.name)", "methods": ["Possible exploitation of a depth counting error in aioxmpp to cause a remote Denial of Service or Data Injection.", "Error suppressing to make the bug exploitable.", "Not using error handlers to mitigate the vulnerability."]}
