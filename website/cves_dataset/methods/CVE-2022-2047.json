{"description": "### Description\nURI use within Jetty's `HttpURI` class can parse invalid URIs such as `http://localhost;/path` as having an authority with a host of `localhost;`.\n\nA URIs of the type `http://localhost;/path` should be interpreted to be either invalid or as `localhost;` to be the userinfo and no host.\nHowever, `HttpURI.host` returns `localhost;` which is definitely wrong.\n\n### Impact\nThis can lead to errors with Jetty's `HttpClient`, and Jetty's `ProxyServlet` / `AsyncProxyServlet` / `AsyncMiddleManServlet` wrongly interpreting an authority with no host as one with a host.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in PR [#8146](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/8146) for Jetty version 9.4.47.\nPatched in PR [#8014](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/pull/8015) for Jetty versions 10.0.10, and 11.0.10\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at security@webtide.com.", "methods": ["Invalid input validation in URI parsing.", "Incorrect handling of invalid URIs.", "Incorrect interpretation of URI authority.", "Incorrect handling of URI userinfo and host."]}
