{"description": "When using [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios), its dependency follow-redirects only clears authorization header during cross-domain redirect, but allows the proxy-authentication header which contains credentials too.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce & PoC\n\nTest code:\n\n```js\nconst axios = require('axios');\n\naxios.get('http://127.0.0.1:10081/', {\n headers: {\n 'AuThorization': 'Rear Test',\n 'ProXy-AuthoriZation': 'Rear Test',\n 'coOkie': 't=1'\n }\n})\n .then((response) => {\n console.log(response);\n })\n```\n\nWhen I meet the cross-domain redirect, the sensitive headers like authorization and cookie are cleared, but proxy-authentication header is kept.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vulnerability may lead to credentials leak.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nRemove proxy-authentication header during cross-domain redirect\n\n### Recommended Patch\n\n[follow-redirects/index.js:464](https://github.com/follow-redirects/follow-redirects/commit/c4f847f85176991f95ab9c88af63b1294de8649b)\n\n```diff\n- removeMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|cookie)$/i, this._options.headers);\n+ removeMatchingHeaders(/^(?:authorization|proxy-authorization|cookie)$/i, this._options.headers);\n```", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the follow-redirects library to keep proxy-authentication headers across hosts.", "Sent sensitive headers (Authorization and Cookie) to a different domain.", "Kept proxy-authentication headers during cross-domain redirect.", "Leaked credentials due to the vulnerability."]}
