Immediate action should be taken to secure your site - see patches & workarounds below.\n\nIt is highly recommended to regenerate all API keys after patching or applying the workaround below.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in 4.10.0, all 4.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Disable all non-Administrator accounts to prevent API access.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* email us at security@ghost.org\n\n---\nCredits: Aden Yap Chuen Zhen, BAE Systems Applied Intelligence (Malaysia)", "methods": ["All authenticated users can access Admin-level API keys via the integrations API endpoint.", "All non-Administrator accounts can access API keys.", "All users can view admin-level API keys.", "All users can access API keys."]}
