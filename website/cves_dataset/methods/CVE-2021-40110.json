This affected Apache James prior to 3.6.1 We recommend upgrading to Apache James 3.6.1 or higher , which enforce the use of RE2J regular expression engine to execute regex in linear time without back-tracking.", "methods": ["Used a fuzzer (Jazzer) to identify a vulnerability in Apache James.", "Crafted IMAP LIST commands to orchestrate a Denial Of Service.", "Exploited a vulnerable Regular expression in Apache James.", "Used a vulnerable Regular expression to cause back-tracking.", "Used a vulnerable Regular expression to cause a Denial Of Service."]}
