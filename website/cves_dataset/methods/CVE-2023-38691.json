{"description": "### Impact\n\nA malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API.\n\n### Details\n\nThe library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the same as the servername we are talking to. A malicious actor could spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a `sub` parameter according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisable the provisioning API. If the bridge does not use the provisioning API, you are not vulnerable.\n", "methods": ["Impersonation of users through OpenID exchange.", "Unauthorized access to provisioning APIs.", "Lack of verification of servername in OpenID exchange.", "Use of foreign user's MXID in OpenID exchange.", "Impersonation of users when using the provisioning API."]}
