{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe whitespace normalisation using in 1.x and 2.x removes any unicode whitespace. Under certain specific conditions this could potentially allow a malicious user to execute code remotely.\n\nThe conditions: \n\n- A user is allowed to supply the path or filename of an uploaded file.\n- The supplied path or filename is not checked against unicode chars.\n- The supplied pathname checked against an extension deny-list, not an allow-list.\n- The supplied path or filename contains a unicode whitespace char in the extension.\n- The uploaded file is stored in a directory that allows PHP code to be executed.\n\nGiven these conditions are met a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the system under attack.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe unicode whitespace removal has been replaced with a rejection (exception).\n\nThe library has been patched in:\n- 1.x: https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/commit/f3ad69181b8afed2c9edf7be5a2918144ff4ea32\n- 2.x: https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem/commit/a3c694de9f7e844b76f9d1b61296ebf6e8d89d74\n\n### Workarounds\n\nFor 1.x users, upgrade to 1.1.4. For 2.x users, upgrade to 2.1.1.\n", "methods": ["An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the system under attack.", "A user can supply a malicious path or filename with unicode whitespace chars to bypass checks.", "The system does not check the supplied path or filename against an allow-list.", "The system allows PHP code to be executed in a directory where uploaded files are stored.", "The system does not properly validate user-supplied input."]}
