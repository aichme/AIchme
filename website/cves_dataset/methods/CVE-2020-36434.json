{"description": "Affected versions of sys-info use a static, global, list to store temporary disk information while running. The function that cleans up this list, DFCleanup, assumes a single threaded environment and will try to free the same memory twice in a multithreaded environment. This results in consistent double-frees and segfaults when calling sys_info::disk_info from multiple threads at once. The issue was fixed by moving the global variable into a local scope.", "methods": ["Double free in sys-info function.", "Use of multithreading.", "Use of global variables.", "Use of function DFCleanup.", "Use of sys_info::disk_info function."]}
