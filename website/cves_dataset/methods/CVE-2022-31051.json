{"description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nSecrets that would normally be masked by semantic-release can be accidentally disclosed if they contain characters that are excluded from uri encoding by [encodeURI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI). Occurrence is further limited to execution contexts where push access to the related repository is not available without modifying the repository url to inject credentials.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nFixed in 19.0.3\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nSecrets that do not contain characters that are excluded from encoding with `encodeURI` when included in a URL are already masked properly.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n* https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/releases/tag/v19.0.3\n* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a discussion in [semantic-release discussions](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/discussions)\n", "methods": ["Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor.", "Execution of malicious code through a vulnerability in semantic-release.", "Injection of credentials into a repository URL.", "Use of a vulnerability in a JavaScript library (encodeURI)."]}
