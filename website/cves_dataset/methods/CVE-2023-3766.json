{"description": "A vulnerability was discovered in the odoh-rs rust crate that stems from faulty logic during the parsing of encrypted queries. This issue specifically occurs when processing encrypted query data received from remote clients.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker with knowledge of this vulnerability could craft and send specially designed encrypted queries to targeted ODOH servers running with odoh-rs. Upon successful exploitation, the server will crash abruptly, disrupting its normal operation and rendering the service temporarily unavailable.\n\n### Patches\nUsers are encouraged to update their odoh-rs's rust crate to v1.0.2.", "methods": ["Crafted specially designed encrypted queries to crash targeted ODOH servers.", "Exploited faulty logic during parsing of encrypted queries.", "Disrupted server operation and rendered service temporarily unavailable."]}
