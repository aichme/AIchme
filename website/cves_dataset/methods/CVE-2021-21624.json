{"description": "Items (like jobs) can be organized hierarchically in Jenkins, using the Folders Plugin or something similar. An item is expected to be accessible only if all its ancestors are accessible as well.\n\nRole-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 3.1 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks to determine whether an item should be accessible.\n\nThis allows attackers with Item/Read permission on nested items to access them, even if they lack Item/Read permission for parent folders.\n\nRole-based Authorization Strategy Plugin 3.1.1 requires Item/Read permission on parent items to grant Item/Read permission on an individual item.\n\nAs a workaround in older releases, do not grant permissions on individual items to users who do not have access to parent items.\n\nIn case of problems, the [Java system property](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/) `com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleMap.checkParentPermissions` can be set to false, completely disabling this fix.", "methods": ["Incorrect permission checks in Jenkins Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin may allow accessing some items.", "Exploitation of a vulnerability in a plugin (Jenkins Role-based Authorization Strategy Plugin) to access restricted items.", "Bypass of permission checks to access nested items without Item/Read permission on parent folders."]}
