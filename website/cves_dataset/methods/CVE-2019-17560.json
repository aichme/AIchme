NetBeans releases before the Apache transition started may also be affected.", "methods": ["Intercepted downloads of autoupdates.", "Modified downloads to inject malicious code.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Apache NetBeans autoupdate system.", "Failed to validate SSL certificates.", "Failed to validate hostnames."]}
