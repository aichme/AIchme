{"description": "In Apache Solr, the DataImportHandler, an optional but popular module to pull in data from databases and other sources, has a feature in which the whole DIH configuration can come from a request's \"dataConfig\" parameter. The debug mode of the DIH admin screen uses this to allow convenient debugging / development of a DIH config. Since a DIH config can contain scripts, this parameter is a security risk. Starting with version 8.2.0 of Solr, use of this parameter requires setting the Java System property \"enable.dih.dataConfigParam\" to true.", "methods": ["Used XXE injection in Apache Solr DataImportHandler.", "Used a security risk in the DIH config to execute scripts.", "Leveraged a Java System property to enable a security risk."]}
