{"description": "### Impact\n\nIf you have explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag, an attacker could craft HTML that includes script after passing through the sanitizer. The default settings disallow the `<style>` tag so there is no risk if you have not explicitly allowed the `<style>` tag.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been fixed in version 5.0.372.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRemove the `<style>` tag from the set of allowed tags.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory open an issue in https://github.com/mganss/HtmlSanitizer\n\n### Credits\n\nThis issue was discovered by Michal Bentkowski of Securitum.", "methods": ["Used XSS to craft HTML that includes script after passing through the sanitizer.", "Used the `<style>` tag to bypass HtmlSanitizer."]}
