{"description": "The OpenSSL gem for Ruby uses the same initialization vector (IV) in GCM Mode (aes-*-gcm) when the IV is set before the key, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to bypass the encryption protection mechanism.", "methods": ["Uses weak encryption due to inadequate initialization vector (IV) in GCM Mode.", "Bypasses encryption protection mechanism."]}
