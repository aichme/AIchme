{"description": "### Impact\nThere is a potential for segfault / denial of service in TensorFlow by calling `tf.compat.v1.*` ops which don't yet have support for quantized types (added after migration to TF 2.x):\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.compat.v1.placeholder_with_default(input=np.array([2]),shape=tf.constant(dtype=tf.qint8, value=np.array([1])))\n```\n\nIn these scenarios, since the kernel is missing, a [`nullptr` value is passed](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f3b9bf4c3c0597563b289c0512e98d4ce81f886e/tensorflow/python/eager/pywrap_tfe_src.cc#L480-L482) to [`ParseDimensionValue`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/f3b9bf4c3c0597563b289c0512e98d4ce81f886e/tensorflow/python/eager/pywrap_tfe_src.cc#L296-L320) for the `py_value` argument. Then, this is dereferenced, resulting in segfault.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [237822b59fc504dda2c564787f5d3ad9c4aa62d9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/237822b59fc504dda2c564787f5d3ad9c4aa62d9).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.9.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.8.1, TensorFlow 2.7.2, and TensorFlow 2.6.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Hong Jin from Singapore Management University.", "methods": ["None"]}
