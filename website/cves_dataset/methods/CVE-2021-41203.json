{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can trigger undefined behavior, integer overflows, segfaults and `CHECK`-fail crashes if they can change saved checkpoints from outside of TensorFlow.\n\nThis is because the checkpoints loading infrastructure is missing validation for invalid file formats.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commits [b619c6f865715ca3b15ef1842b5b95edbaa710ad](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b619c6f865715ca3b15ef1842b5b95edbaa710ad), [e8dc63704c88007ee4713076605c90188d66f3d2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e8dc63704c88007ee4713076605c90188d66f3d2), [368af875869a204b4ac552b9ddda59f6a46a56ec](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/368af875869a204b4ac552b9ddda59f6a46a56ec), and [abcced051cb1bd8fb05046ac3b6023a7ebcc4578](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/abcced051cb1bd8fb05046ac3b6023a7ebcc4578).\n\nThese fixes will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information \nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["Missing validation during checkpoint loading can be exploited to trigger undefined behavior, integer overflows, segfaults, and CHECK-fail crashes.", "An attacker can change saved checkpoints from outside of TensorFlow."]}
