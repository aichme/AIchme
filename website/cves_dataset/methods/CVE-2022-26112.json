{"description": "Pinot allows you to run any function using Apache Groovy scripts. In versions prior to 0.10.0, Pinot query endpoint and realtime ingestion layer has a vulnerability in unprotected environments due to groovy function support being enabled by default. This issue has been fixed by making function support disabled by default, in version 0.11.0. A potential workaround is to disable groovy script support.", "methods": ["Enabled Groovy function support by default.", "Allows execution of arbitrary functions using Apache Groovy scripts.", "Potential workaround: disable Groovy script support."]}
