The library is already available as a dependency in the PrestaShop project. Beware though that in legacy object models, fields of `HTML` type will call `isCleanHTML`.\n\n### Reporters\n\nReported by Antonio Russo (@Antonio-R1 on GitHub) and Antonio Rocco Spataro (@antoniospataro on GitHub).\n\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the Validate::isCleanHTML method to inject malicious HTML.", "Injected malicious HTML to potentially exploit XSS."]}
