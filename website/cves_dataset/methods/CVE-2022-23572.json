{"description": "### Impact\nUnder certain scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during [shape inference](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/a1320ec1eac186da1d03f033109191f715b2b130/tensorflow/core/framework/shape_inference.cc#L168-L174):\n\n```cc\nvoid InferenceContext::PreInputInit(\n    const OpDef& op_def, const std::vector<const Tensor*>& input_tensors,\n    const std::vector<ShapeHandle>& input_tensors_as_shapes) {\n  const auto ret = full_type::SpecializeType(attrs_, op_def);\n  DCHECK(ret.status().ok()) << \"while instantiating types: \" << ret.status();\n  ret_types_ = ret.ValueOrDie();\n  // ... \n}\n```\n\nHowever, `DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie` line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error `Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to the assertion failure.\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/cb164786dc891ea11d3a900e90367c339305dc7b).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["Crash the system by exploiting a type specialization failure in TensorFlow.", "Trigger an assertion failure in debug builds.", "Trigger a crash in debug builds."]}
