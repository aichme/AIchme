{"description": "### Impact\nCVE-2021-3007: Backport of Zend_Http_Response_Stream, added certain type checking as a way to prevent exploitation. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3007\n\nThis vulnerability is caused by the unsecured deserialization of an object. In versions higher than Zend Framework 3.0.0, the attacker abuses the Zend3 feature that loads classes from objects in order to upload and execute malicious code in the server. The code can be uploaded using the \u201ccallback\u201d parameter, which in this case inserts a malicious code instead of the \u201ccallbackOptions\u201d array.\n\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\nv20.0.9 v19.4.13", "methods": ["Used deserialization of an object to upload and execute malicious code.", "Used the \"callback\" parameter to insert malicious code instead of the \"callbackOptions\" array.", "Used the Zend3 feature to load classes from objects.", "Used the Zend Framework's Stream HTTP Wrapper to upload and execute malicious code."]}
