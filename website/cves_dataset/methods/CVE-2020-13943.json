{"description": "If an HTTP/2 client connecting to Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M7, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.37 or 8.5.0 to 8.5.57 exceeded the agreed maximum number of concurrent streams for a connection (in violation of the HTTP/2 protocol), it was possible that a subsequent request made on that connection could contain HTTP headers - including HTTP/2 pseudo headers - from a previous request rather than the intended headers. This could lead to users seeing responses for unexpected resources.", "methods": ["Exposed sensitive information to an unauthorized actor via HTTP/2 protocol vulnerability in Apache Tomcat.", "Exploited HTTP/2 protocol vulnerability to intercept and manipulate HTTP headers.", "Manipulated HTTP headers to display unintended responses to users."]}
