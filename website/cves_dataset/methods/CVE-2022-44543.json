{"description": "The TYPO3 Extension femanager prior to versions 5.5.2, 6.3.3, and 7.0.1 is vulnerable to broken access control. The `usergroup.inList` validation can be bypassed resulting in new frontend users created by the extension may be members of groups that are restricted. The vulnerability is only exploitable if the field usergroup is available in the registration form. Versions 5.5.2, 6.3.3, and 7.0.1 contain patches.", "methods": ["Bypassed access control checks in the TYPO3 Extension femanager.", "Created new frontend users with restricted group membership."]}
