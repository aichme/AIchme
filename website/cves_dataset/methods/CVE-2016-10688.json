{"description": "Affected versions of `haxe3` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `haxe3`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been left unpatched for several years, despite active maintenance on the package. Because of this, it appears that the package author has accepted the risk, and is unlikely to patch this package in the future.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised your network or those who have privileged access to your ISP, such as Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees.", "methods": ["Downloads executable over unencrypted HTTP connection.", "Allows interception and replacement of executable by an attacker with a privileged network position.", "Uses a vulnerable package that is unlikely to be patched.", "Uses a vulnerable package that can be exploited by Nation State Actors or Rogue ISP Employees."]}
