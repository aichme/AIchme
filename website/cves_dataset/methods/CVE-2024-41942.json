{"description": "### Summary\n\nIf a user is granted the `admin:users` scope, they may escalate their own privileges by making themselves a full admin user.\n\n### Details\n\nThe `admin:users` scope allows a user to edit user records:\n\n> admin:users\n>\n> Read, write, create and delete users and their authentication state, not including their servers or tokens.\n>\n> -- https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rbac/scopes.html#available-scopes\n\nHowever, this includes making users admins. Admin users are granted scopes beyond `admin:users` making this a mechanism by which granted scopes may be escalated.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe impact is relatively small in that `admin:users` is already an extremely privileged scope only granted to trusted users.\nIn effect, `admin:users` is equivalent to `admin=True`, which is not intended.\n\nNote that the change here only prevents escalation to the built-in JupyterHub admin role that has unrestricted permissions. It does not prevent users with e.g. `groups` permissions from granting themselves or other users permissions via group membership, which is intentional.", "methods": ["Escalate privileges by making themselves a full admin user.", "Use a privileged scope to gain access to scopes beyond the granted scope.", "Grant scopes to other users via group membership."]}
