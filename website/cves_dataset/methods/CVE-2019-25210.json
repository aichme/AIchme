{"description": "An issue was discovered in Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Helm. It displays values of secrets when the --dry-run flag is used. This is a security concern in some use cases, such as a --dry-run call by a CI/CD tool. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this behavior was introduced intentionally, and cannot be removed without breaking backwards compatibility (some users may be relying on these values).", "methods": ["Uses a feature to display sensitive information in clear text.", "Uses a feature to display sensitive information in a CI/CD tool."]}
