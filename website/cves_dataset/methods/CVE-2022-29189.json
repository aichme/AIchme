An attacker could exploit this to cause excessive memory usage.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.4\n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds available, upgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.4\n\n### References\nThank you to [Juho Nurminen](https://github.com/jupenur) and the Mattermost team for discovering and reporting this. \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Pion DTLS](http://github.com/pion/dtls)\n* Email us at [team@pion.ly](mailto:team@pion.ly)\n", "methods": ["Buffer overflow via excessive memory usage.", "Excessive resource consumption."]}
