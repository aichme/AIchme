{"description": "Description\n-----------\n\nWhen a `Response` does not contain a `Content-Type` header, Symfony falls back to the format defined in the `Accept` header of the request, leading to a possible mismatch between the response's content and `Content-Type` header. When the response is cached, this can lead to a corrupted cache where the cached format is not the right one.\n\nResolution\n----------\n\nSymfony does not use the `Accept` header anymore to guess the `Content-Type`.\n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/dca343442e6a954f96a2609e7b4e9c21ed6d74e6) for the 4.4 branch.\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nI would like to thank Xavier Lacot from JoliCode for reporting & Yonel Ceruto and Tobias Schultze for fixing the issue.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in Symfony to manipulate the Response Content-Type header.", "Exploited a mismatch between the response's content and Content-Type header to corrupt the cache."]}
