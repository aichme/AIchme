{"description": "### Impact\nA malicious homeserver can craft a room or room structure such that the predecessors form a cycle. The matrix-js-sdk's `getRoomUpgradeHistory` function will infinitely recurse in this case, causing the code to hang. This method is public but also called by the 'leaveRoomChain()' method, so leaving a room will also trigger the bug.\n\nEven if the CVSS score would be 4.1 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L&version=3.1)) we classify this as High severity issue.\n\n### Patches\nThis was patched in matrix-js-sdk 34.3.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nSanity check rooms before passing them to the matrix-js-sdk or avoid calling either `getRoomUpgradeHistory` or `leaveRoomChain`.\n\n### References\nN/A.\n", "methods": ["Used a logic error in the `getRoomUpgradeHistory` function to cause infinite recursion.", "Used a logic error in the `leaveRoomChain()` method to cause infinite recursion.", "Created a malicious homeserver to craft a room or room structure with a cycle.", "Used a public method to trigger a bug.", "Used a public method to call a method that triggers a bug."]}
