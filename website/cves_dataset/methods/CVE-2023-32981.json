{"description": "Jenkins Pipeline Utility Steps Plugin provides the `untar` and `unzip` Pipeline steps to extract archives into job workspaces.\n\nPipeline Utility Steps Plugin 2.15.2 and earlier does not validate or limit file paths of files contained within these archives.\n\nThis allows attackers able to provide crafted archives as parameters to create or replace arbitrary files on the agent file system with attacker-specified content.\n\nPipeline Utility Steps Plugin 2.15.3 rejects extraction of files in `tar` and `zip` archives that would be placed outside the expected destination directory.", "methods": ["Created arbitrary files on the agent file system.", "Wrote files to the agent file system with attacker-specified content.", "Escalated privileges by creating files in arbitrary locations.", "Executed arbitrary code on the agent file system."]}
