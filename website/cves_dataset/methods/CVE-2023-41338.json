{"description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability can be categorized as a security misconfiguration. It impacts users of our project who rely on the [ctx.IsFromLocal()](https://docs.gofiber.io/api/ctx#isfromlocal) method to restrict access to localhost requests. If exploited, it could allow unauthorized access to resources intended only for localhost.\n\nIn it's implementation it uses c.IPs():\n\n```go\n// IPs returns a string slice of IP addresses specified in the X-Forwarded-For request header.\n// When IP validation is enabled, only valid IPs are returned.\nfunc (c *Ctx) IPs() []string {\n    return c.extractIPsFromHeader(HeaderXForwardedFor)\n}\n```\n\nThereby, setting `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` in a request from a foreign host, will result in true for [ctx.IsFromLocal()](https://docs.gofiber.io/api/ctx#isfromlocal) \n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in `v2.49.2` with commit [b8c9ede6efa231116c4bd8bb9d5e03eac1cb76dc](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/commit/b8c9ede6efa231116c4bd8bb9d5e03eac1cb76dc)\n\n### Workarounds\nCurrently, there are no known workarounds to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading to the patched version. We strongly advise users to apply the patch as soon as it is released.\n\n### References\nFor further information and context regarding this security issue, please refer to the following resources:\n\n- [Mozilla Developer Network - X-Forwarded-For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For)\n\n", "methods": ["Manipulated HTTP headers to bypass IP validation.", "Exploited a security misconfiguration in the `ctx.IsFromLocal()` method.", "Used a foreign IP address to spoof a localhost request."]}
