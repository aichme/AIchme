This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 that fix the problem described.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Paul Keller, Mathias Bolt Lesniak and Kay Strobach who reported this issue and to TYPO3 framework merger Frank N\u00e4gler and to TYPO3 security team member Torben Hansen who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2021-005](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2021-005)", "methods": ["Triggers page error handler to amplify the impact of the initial attack.", "Calls itself recursively to exceed web server limits."]}
