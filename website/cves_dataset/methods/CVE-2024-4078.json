{"description": "A vulnerability in the parisneo/lollms, specifically in the `/unInstall_binding` endpoint, allows for arbitrary code execution due to insufficient sanitization of user input. The issue arises from the lack of path sanitization when handling the `name` parameter in the `unInstall_binding` function, allowing an attacker to traverse directories and execute arbitrary code by loading a malicious `__init__.py` file. This vulnerability affects the latest version of the software. The exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote code execution on the system where parisneo/lollms is deployed.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary code execution to execute malicious code.", "Used path traversal to load a malicious __init__.py file.", "Executed code remotely on the system where parisneo/lollms is deployed."]}
