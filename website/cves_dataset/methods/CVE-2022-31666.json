API call is\n\n\u00a0 GET /projects/{project_name_or_id}/webhook/policies/{webhook_policy_id}\n\nBy sending the below request and specifying different Webhook policy ids in the last part of the URL, the malicious user may disclose Webhook policies related to other repositories/projects.: none;\">\n\n### Patches\nThis and similar issues are fixed in Harbor v2.5.2 and later.
