{"description": "Versions of `samlify` prior to 2.4.0-rc5 are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass. The package fails to prevent XML Signature Wrapping, allowing tokens to be reused with different usernames. A remote attacker can modify SAML content for a SAML service provider without invalidating the cryptographic signature, which may allow attackers to bypass primary authentication for the affected SAML service provider.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.4.0-rc5 or later", "methods": ["Allows tokens to be reused with different usernames.", "Fails to prevent XML Signature Wrapping.", "Allows attackers to bypass primary authentication.", "Allows attackers to modify SAML content."]}
