{"description": "When using Apache Shiro before 1.11.0 together with Spring Boot 2.6+, a specially crafted HTTP request may cause an authentication bypass. The authentication bypass occurs when Shiro and Spring Boot are using different pattern-matching techniques. Both Shiro and Spring Boot < 2.6 default to Ant style pattern matching. Mitigation: Update to Apache Shiro 1.11.0, or set the following Spring Boot configuration value: `spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy = ant_path_matcher`", "methods": ["Uses a specially crafted HTTP request to bypass authentication.", "Exploits a pattern-matching conflict between Apache Shiro and Spring Boot.", "Uses a vulnerability in Apache Shiro before 1.11.0.", "Exploits a configuration weakness in Spring Boot 2.6+."]}
