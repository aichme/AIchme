{"description": "Impact\nSOFARPC defaults to using the SOFA Hessian protocol to deserialize received data, while the SOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components.\n\nPatches\nFixed this issue by adding a blacklist, users can upgrade to sofarpc version 5.12.0 to avoid this issue.\n\nWorkarounds\nSOFARPC also provides a way to add additional blacklist. Users can add some class like -Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=org.apache.xpath. to avoid this issue.", "methods": ["Bypasses blacklist protection mechanism in SOFA Hessian protocol.", "Uses gadget chain to execute malicious code.", "Executes malicious code without relying on third-party components.", "Uses JDK to execute malicious code.", "Executes remote command."]}
