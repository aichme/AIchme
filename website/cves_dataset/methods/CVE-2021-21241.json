{"description": "### Issue\nThe  /login and /change endpoints can return the authenticated user's authentication token in response to a GET request. Since GET requests aren't protected with a CSRF token, this could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring the authentication token.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 3.4.5 and soon to be released 4.0.0 are patched.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you aren't using authentication tokens - you can set the SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to \"0\" (seconds) which should make the token unusable.\n\n### References\nNone", "methods": ["Exposed authentication token via GET request to /login and /change endpoints.", "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability."]}
