This is bad security practice.\n\nDesired solution\nThe refresh token should get a validity of 24-48 hours.\n\nAdditional context\n\nWhen implementing this, also check that the refresh token returns a new refresh token\nWhen implementing this, also adapt the UI so that it logs out if refresh token is no longer valid.\nWhen implementing this, ensure that nodes refresh their token periodically so that they do not have to be restarted manually.\n\n\n### Impact\n### Patches\nNone available \n\n### Workarounds\nNone available\n\n", "methods": ["Implemented insecure token management, allowing refresh tokens to be valid indefinitely.", "Implemented insecure token management, allowing refresh tokens to be valid for 24-48 hours.", "Implemented token refresh, returning a new refresh token.", "Implemented token validation, logging out user if refresh token is no longer valid.", "Implemented periodic token refresh, ensuring nodes do not require manual restart."]}
