{"description": "### Impact \nThe [implementation of `QuantizedMaxPool`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_pooling_ops.cc#L114-L130) has an undefined behavior where user controlled inputs can trigger a reference binding to null pointer.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.QuantizedMaxPool(\n    input = tf.constant([[[[4]]]], dtype=tf.quint8),\n    min_input = [],\n    max_input = [1],\n    ksize = [1, 1, 1, 1],\n    strides = [1, 1, 1, 1],\n    padding = \"SAME\", name=None\n)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [53b0dd6dc5957652f35964af16b892ec9af4a559](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/53b0dd6dc5957652f35964af16b892ec9af4a559).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Faysal Hossain Shezan from University of Virginia.", "methods": ["Used undefined behavior to trigger a null pointer dereference.", "Used user-controlled inputs to trigger undefined behavior.", "Used a GitHub commit to patch the issue.", "Used a cherrypick to apply the patch to other versions.", "Used a security guide for more information on the security model.", "Used a contact method to report issues and questions."]}
