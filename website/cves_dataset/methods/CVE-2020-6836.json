{"description": "Versions of `hot-formula-parser` prior to 3.0.1 are vulnerable to Command Injection. The package fails to sanitize values passed to the  `parse` function and concatenates it in an `eval` call. If a value of the formula is supplied by user-controlled input it may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the server.  \nParsing the following formula creates a `test` file in the present directory:  \n`\"SUM([(function(){require('child_process').execSync('touch test')})(),2])\"`\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 3.0.1 or later.", "methods": ["Used Command Injection to run arbitrary commands in the server.", "Used user-controlled input to execute system commands.", "Executed system commands using the `eval` function.", "Created a file on the server using the `touch` command."]}
