{"description": "Apache NiFi is a system to process and distribute data. Multiple components in Apache NiFi 0.0.1 to 1.16.0 do not restrict XML External Entity references in the default configuration. The Standard Content Viewer service attempts to resolve XML External Entity references when viewing formatted XML files. The following Processors attempt to resolve XML External Entity references when configured with default property values: \n- EvaluateXPath \n- EvaluateXQuery \n- ValidateXml \n\nApache NiFi flow configurations that include these Processors are vulnerable to malicious XML documents that contain Document Type Declarations with XML External Entity references. NiFi 1.16.1 disables Document Type Declarations in the default configuration for these Processors and disallows XML External Entity resolution in standard services.", "methods": ["Uses XML External Entity references in malicious XML documents.", "Resolves XML External Entity references in XML files.", "Does not restrict XML External Entity references in default configuration.", "Attempts to resolve XML External Entity references in EvaluateXPath, EvaluateXQuery, and ValidateXml Processors.", "Disables Document Type Declarations in default configuration for EvaluateXPath, EvaluateXQuery, and ValidateXml Processors.", "Disallows XML External Entity resolution in standard services."]}
