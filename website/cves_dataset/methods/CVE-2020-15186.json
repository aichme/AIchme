Examine the `name` field in the `plugin.yaml` file for a plugin, looking for characters outside of the [a-zA-Z0-9._-] range.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the sanitization of plugin names in Helm.", "Executed unexpected behavior by duplicating the name of another plugin.", "Spoofed the output to `helm --help`.", "Installed untrusted Helm plugins.", "Examined the `name` field in the `plugin.yaml` file for suspicious characters."]}
