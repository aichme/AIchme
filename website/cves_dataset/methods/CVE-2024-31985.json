{"description": "### Impact\nIt is possible to schedule/trigger/unschedule existing jobs by having an admin visit the Job Scheduler page through a predictable URL, for example by embedding such an URL in any content as an image.\n\nTo reproduce in an XWiki installation, open `<xwiki-host>:/xwiki/bin/view/Scheduler/?do=trigger&which=Scheduler.NotificationEmailDailySender` as a user with admin rights. If there is no error message that indicates the CSRF token is invalid, the installation is vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\nThe vulnerability has been fixed on XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.5, and 15.9.\n\n### Workarounds\nModify the Scheduler.WebHome page following this [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/f16ca4ef1513f84ce2e685d4a05d689bd3a2ab4c#diff-1e2995eacccbbbdcc4987ff64f46ac74837d166cf9e92920b4a4f8af0f10bd47).\n\n### References\n- https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20851\n- https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/f16ca4ef1513f84ce2e685d4a05d689bd3a2ab4c", "methods": ["Used a predictable URL to trigger a CSRF attack on the Job Scheduler page.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the XWiki Platform to schedule/trigger/unschedule existing jobs."]}
