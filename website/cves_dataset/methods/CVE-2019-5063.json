{"description": "An exploitable heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the data structure persistence functionality of OpenCV 4.1.0 (corresponds with OpenCV-Python 4.1.0.25). A specially crafted XML file can cause a buffer overflow, resulting in multiple heap corruptions and potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted file to trigger this vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used a specially crafted XML file to trigger a heap buffer overflow.", "Executed arbitrary code through heap corruption.", "Manipulated the data structure of OpenCV 4.1.0."]}
