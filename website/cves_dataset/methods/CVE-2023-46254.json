{"description": "### Summary\n\nA bug in the RoleBinding reflector used by `capsule-proxy` gives ServiceAccount tenant owners the right to list Namespaces of other tenants backed by the same owner kind and name.\n\n### Details\n\n- Tenant `solar`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `solar`\n- Tenant `wind`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `wind`\n\n> Please, notice the same ServiceAccount name, although in different namespaces.\n\nThe Tenant owner `solar` would be able to list the namespaces of the Tenant `wind` and vice-versa, although this is not correct.\n\nThe bug introduces an exfiltration vulnerability since allows the listing of Namespace resources of other Tenants, although just in some specific conditions:\n\n1. `capsule-proxy` runs with the `--disable-caching=false` (default value: `false`)\n2. Tenant owners are ServiceAccount, with the same resource name, but in different Namespaces.\n\nThe CVE doesn't allow any privilege escalation on the outer tenant Namespace-scoped resources, since the Kubernetes RBAC is enforcing this.", "methods": ["Used a bug in the RoleBinding reflector to disclose Namespaces of colliding tenants to owners of different tenants with the same ServiceAccount name.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the `capsule-proxy` service to list Namespaces of other tenants backed by the same owner kind and name.", "Used a ServiceAccount with the same name in different Namespaces to gain unauthorized access to Namespace resources.", "Exploited a misconfigured `capsule-proxy` service that runs with `--disable-caching=false` to exfiltrate Namespace resources."]}
