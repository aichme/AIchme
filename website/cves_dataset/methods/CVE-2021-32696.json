{"description": "A type-confusion vulnerability can cause `striptags` to concatenate unsanitized strings when an array-like object is passed in as the `html` parameter. This can be abused by an attacker who can control the shape of their input, e.g. if query parameters are passed directly into the function.\n\n### Impact\n\nXSS\n\n### Patches\n\n`3.2.0`\n\n### Workarounds\n\nEnsure that the `html` parameter is a string before calling the function.\n", "methods": ["Passed unsanitized input to a function to cause XSS.", "Used type-confusion vulnerability to concatenate unsanitized strings.", "Passed array-like object as a string parameter to a function."]}
