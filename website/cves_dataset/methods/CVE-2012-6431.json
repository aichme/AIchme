{"description": "On the Symfony 2.0.x version, there's a security issue that allows access to routes protected by a firewall even when the user is not logged in.\n\nBoth the Routing component and the Security component uses the path returned by `getPathInfo()` to match a Request. The `getPathInfo()` returns a decoded path, but the Routing component (`Symfony\\Component\\Routing\\Matcher\\UrlMatcher`) decodes the path a second time; whereas the Security component, `Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\RequestMatcher`, does not.\n\nThis difference causes Symfony 2.0 to be vulnerable to double encoding attacks.\n\n", "methods": ["Used double-encoded strings to bypass URI restrictions.", "Exploited difference in path decoding between components.", "Leveraged double encoding attacks."]}
