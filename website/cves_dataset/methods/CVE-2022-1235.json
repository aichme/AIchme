{"description": "The secrethash, which the application relies for multiple security measures, can be brute-forced. The hash is quite small, with only 10 characters of only hexadecimal, making 16^10 possilibities ( 1.099.511.627.776 ). The SHA1 of the secret can be obtained via a captcha string and brute-forced offline with an GPU.", "methods": ["Brute force of weak password hash.", "Offline password guessing.", "Use of GPU for brute-forcing."]}
