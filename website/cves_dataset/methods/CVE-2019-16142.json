{"description": "Affected versions of this crate exposed several methods which took self by immutable reference, despite the requesting the RenderDoc API to set a mutable value internally. This is technically unsound and calling these methods from multiple threads without synchronization could lead to unexpected and unpredictable behavior. The flaw was corrected in release 0.5.0.", "methods": ["Used an insecure API to set a mutable value internally.", "Failed to synchronize access to shared resources across multiple threads."]}
