{"description": "### Impact\nVulnerable jsrsasign will accept RSA signature with improper PKCS#1.5 padding.\nDecoded RSA signature value consists following form:\n`01(ff...(8 or more ffs)...ff)00[ASN.1 OF DigestInfo]`\nIts byte length must be the same as RSA key length, however such checking was not sufficient.\n\nTo make crafted message for practical attack is very hard.\n\n### Patches\nUsers validating RSA signature should upgrade to 10.2.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere is no workaround. Not to use RSA signature validation in jsrsasign.\n\n### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThanks to Daniel Yahyazadeh @yahyazadeh for reporting and analyzing this vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in RSA signature validation to bypass security controls.", "Created a crafted message to exploit the vulnerability.", "Used a maleable encoded message to evade detection.", "Exploited a vulnerability in a library (jsrsasign) to gain unauthorized access."]}
