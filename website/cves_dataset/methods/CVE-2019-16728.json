{"description": "Versions of `dompurify` prior to 2.0.3 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package has an XSS filter bypass due to Mutation XSS in both Chrome and Safari through a combination of `<svg>`/`<math>` elements and `</p>`/`</br>`. An example payload is: `<svg></p><style><a id=\"</style><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>\">`. This allows attackers to bypass the XSS protection and execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 2.0.3 or later. You may also disallow `<svg>` and `<math>` through `dompurify` configurations:\n```DOMPurify.sanitize(input, {\n     FORBID_TAGS: ['svg', 'math']\n });```", "methods": ["Uses Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser.", "Uses Mutation XSS to bypass XSS protection in Chrome and Safari.", "Uses `<svg>` and `<math>` elements to bypass XSS protection.", "Uses `<style>` and `<img>` elements to execute malicious code.", "Uses `</p>` and `</br>` elements to bypass XSS protection."]}
