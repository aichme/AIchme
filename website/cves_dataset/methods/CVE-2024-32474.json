{"description": "### Impact\nWhen authenticating as a superuser to a self-hosted Sentry instance with a username and password, the password is leaked as cleartext in logs under the _event_: `auth-index.validate_superuser`. An attacker with access to the log data could use these leaked credentials to login to the Sentry system as superuser.\n\n### Patches\n- Self-hosted users on affected versions should upgrade to 24.4.1 or later.\n- Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action. This vulnerability is not applicable to SaaS.\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can configure the logging level to exclude logs of the `INFO` level and only generate logs for levels at `WARNING` or higher. For details on configuring self-hosted Sentry's logging level see our documentation at: https://develop.sentry.dev/config/#logging\n\n### References\n- Bug introduced in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/66393\n- Security fix in https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/pull/69148", "methods": ["Leaked cleartext superuser password in logs.", "Used authentication with username and password.", "Accessed self-hosted Sentry instance.", "Accessed Sentry system as superuser.", "Configured logging level to exclude logs of the INFO level.", "Configured logging level to only generate logs for levels at WARNING or higher."]}
