{"description": "Jenkins NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin 4.8.0.77 and earlier does not escape the name of NetStorm Test parameters on views displaying parameters, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.\n\nExploitation of this vulnerability requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the \\\"Build With Parameters\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities of this kind on the \\\"Build With Parameters\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the [SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions) fix. Additionally, several plugins have previously been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default, see [SECURITY-2617 in the 2022-04-12 security advisory for a list](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-04-12/#SECURITY-2617).", "methods": ["Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Jenkins NS-ND Integration Performance Publisher Plugin.", "Exploitation requires Item/Configure permission.", "Vulnerability is exploitable on views displaying parameters.", "Parameters must be listed on another page, like \"Build With Parameters\" and \"Parameters\" pages.", "Jenkins core has prevented exploitation on \"Build With Parameters\" and \"Parameters\" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2.", "Several plugins have updated to list parameters to prevent exploitation by default."]}
