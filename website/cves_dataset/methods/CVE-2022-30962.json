{"description": "Jenkins Global Variable String Parameter Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not escape the name and description of Global Variable String parameters on views displaying parameters. This results in stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.\n\nExploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the \\\"Build With Parameters\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities of this kind on the \\\"Build With Parameters\\\" and \\\"Parameters\\\" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the [SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions) fix. Additionally, several plugins have previously been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default, see [SECURITY-2617 in the 2022-04-12 security advisory for a list](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-04-12/#SECURITY-2617).", "methods": ["Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Jenkins Global Variable String Parameter Plugin.", "Exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities requires Item/Configure permission.", "Parameters are listed on pages like \"Build With Parameters\" and \"Parameters\".", "Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation on \"Build With Parameters\" and \"Parameters\" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2.", "Parameters are listed in a way that prevents exploitation by default in some plugins."]}
