{"description": "The H2O machine learning platform uses \"Iced\" classes as the primary means of moving Java Objects around the cluster. The Iced format supports inclusion of serialized Java objects. When a model is deserialized, any class is allowed to be deserialized (no class whitelist). An attacker can construct a crafted Iced model that uses Java gadgets and leads to arbitrary code execution when imported to the H2O platform.", "methods": ["Deserialization of untrusted data to execute arbitrary code.", "Use of Java gadgets for code execution.", "Lack of class whitelist for deserialized objects."]}
