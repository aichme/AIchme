{"description": "### Impact\nDuring TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer phase, constant folding might attempt to deep copy a resource tensor. This results in a segfault, as these tensors are supposed to not change.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [7731e8dfbe4a56773be5dc94d631611211156659](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7731e8dfbe4a56773be5dc94d631611211156659).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n    \n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions", "methods": ["None."]}
