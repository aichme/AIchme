{"description": "Jenkins renders several different graphs for features like agent and label usage statistics, memory usage, or various plugin-provided statistics.\n\nJenkins 2.274 and earlier, LTS 2.263.1 and earlier does not limit the graph size provided as query parameters.\n\nThis allows attackers to request or to have legitimate Jenkins users request crafted URLs that rapidly use all available memory in Jenkins, potentially leading to out of memory errors.\n\nJenkins 2.275, LTS 2.263.2 limits the maximum size of graphs to an area of 10 million pixels. If a larger size is requested, the default size for the graph will be rendered instead.\n\nThis threshold can be configured by setting the [Java system property](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/) `hudson.util.Graph.maxArea` to a different number on startup.", "methods": ["Attempted to cause a denial of service (DoS) by requesting excessive memory allocation in Jenkins.", "Exploited a lack of input validation in Jenkins to request large graph sizes.", "Used crafted URLs to request large graph sizes.", "Attempted to consume available memory in Jenkins."]}
