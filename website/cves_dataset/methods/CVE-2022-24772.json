{"description": "### Impact\n\nRSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code does not check for tailing garbage bytes after decoding a `DigestInfo` ASN.1 structure. This can allow padding bytes to be removed and garbage data added to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being used.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been addressed in `node-forge` `1.3.0`.\n\n### References\n\nFor more information, please see\n[\"Bleichenbacher's RSA signature forgery based on implementation error\"](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/5rnE9ZRN1AokBVj3VqblGlP63QE/)\nby Hal Finney.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge)\n* Email us at [example email address](mailto:security@digitalbazaar.com)", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification to forge a signature.", "Removed padding bytes and added garbage data to a `DigestInfo` ASN.1 structure."]}
