{"description": "** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Apache Axis allowed users with access to the admin service to perform possible SSRF.\nThis issue affects Apache Axis through 1.3.\n\nAs Axis 1 has been EOL, we recommend you migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. Alternatively you could use a build of Axis with the patch from https://github.com/apache/axis-axis1-java/commit/685c309febc64aa393b2d64a05f90e7eb9f73e06 applied. The Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release \nfixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work towards this are welcome.", "methods": ["Used SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) to perform unauthorized actions.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Apache Axis to gain unauthorized access."]}
