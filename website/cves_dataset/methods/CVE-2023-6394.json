This issue occurs when receiving a request over websocket with no role-based permission specified on the GraphQL operation, Quarkus processes the request without authentication despite the endpoint being secured. This can allow an attacker to access information and functionality outside of normal granted API permissions.", "methods": ["Bypassed authentication and authorization controls to access unauthorized information and functionality.", "Exploited a flaw in Quarkus to process requests without authentication.", "Accessed information and functionality outside of normal granted API permissions."]}
