{"description": "OGNL provides, among other features, extensive expression evaluation capabilities. This vulnerability allows a malicious user to bypass the '#'-usage protection built into the ParametersInterceptor, thus being able to manipulate server side context objects. This behavior was already addressed in [S2-003](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/S2-003), but it turned out that the resulting fix based on whitelisting acceptable parameter names closed the vulnerability only partially.", "methods": ["Manipulated server-side objects using OGNL expression evaluation capabilities.", "Bypassed parameter name protection in ParametersInterceptor.", "Used whitelisting to partially close the vulnerability.", "Exploited a previously addressed vulnerability (S2-003)."]}
