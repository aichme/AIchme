{"description": "### Vulnerability type\nCryptography\n\n### Workarounds\nRefer to the [gateway documentation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/gateway.md). The vulnerability was spotted due to unclear documentation of how the gateway handles endpoints validation.\n\n### Detail\nWhen starting a gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag. The auditors has noted that appropriate documentation of this validation functionality plus deprecation of this misleading functionality is an acceptable path forward.\n \n### References\nFind out more on this vulnerability in the [security audit report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Contact the [etcd security committee](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/security-release-process.md#product-security-committee-psc)", "methods": ["Misconfigured authentication for TLS.", "Lack of validation for endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag.", "Misleading documentation of validation functionality."]}
