{"description": "### Impact\nWhen `SparseSparseMaximum` is given invalid sparse tensors as inputs, it can give an NPE. \n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ntf.raw_ops.SparseSparseMaximum(\n a_indices=[[1]],\n a_values =[ 0.1 ],\n a_shape = [2],\n b_indices=[[]],\n b_values =[2 ],\n b_shape = [2],\n)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5e0ecfb42f5f65629fd7a4edd6c4afe7ff0feb04](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5e0ecfb42f5f65629fd7a4edd6c4afe7ff0feb04).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.12. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.11.1.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yu Tian of Qihoo 360 AIVul Team", "methods": ["None of the techniques are mentioned in the description."]}
