{"description": "### Impact\nMuch like https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6/security/advisories/GHSA-45gq-q4xh-cp53, it is possible to find which usernames exist in vantage6 by calling the API routes `/recover/lost` and `/2fa/lost`, which send emails to users if they have lost their password or MFA token. Usernames can be found by assessing response time differences, and additionally, they can be found because the endpoint gives a response \"Failed to login\" if the username exists.\n\n### Patches\nNo\n\n### Workarounds\nNo", "methods": ["Used API routes to gather information about existing usernames.", "Used API routes to send emails to users with lost password or MFA token.", "Conducted a timing attack to find existing usernames.", "Used API response to infer the existence of a username."]}
