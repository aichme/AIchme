{"description": "TeamPass before 2.1.27.9 does not properly enforce item access control when requesting items.queries.php. It is then possible to copy any arbitrary item into a directory controlled by the attacker, edit any item within a read-only directory, delete an arbitrary item, delete the file attachments of an arbitrary item, copy the password of an arbitrary item to the copy/paste buffer, access the history of an arbitrary item, and edit attributes of an arbitrary directory. To exploit the vulnerability, an authenticated attacker must tamper with the requests sent directly, for example by changing the \"item_id\" parameter when invoking \"copy_item\" on items.queries.php.", "methods": ["Tampered with HTTP requests to invoke \"copy_item\" on items.queries.php.", "Manipulated the \"item_id\" parameter to access arbitrary items.", "Edited attributes of an arbitrary directory.", "Deleted arbitrary items.", "Copied arbitrary items into a directory controlled by the attacker.", "Edited items within a read-only directory.", "Deleted file attachments of an arbitrary item.", "Accessed the history of an arbitrary item.", "Copied the password of an arbitrary item to the copy/paste buffer."]}
