{"description": "dom4j before 2.1.3 allows external DTDs and External Entities by default, which might enable XXE attacks. However, there is popular external documentation from OWASP showing how to enable the safe, non-default behavior in any application that uses dom4j.\n\nNote: This advisory applies to `dom4j:dom4j` version 1.x legacy artifacts.  To resolve this a change to the latest version of `org.dom4j:dom4j` is recommended.", "methods": ["Allows External Entities by default which might enable XXE attacks.", "Enables XXE attacks."]}
