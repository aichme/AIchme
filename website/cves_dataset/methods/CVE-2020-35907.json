{"description": "Affected versions of the crate used a UnsafeCell in thread-local storage to return a noop waker reference, assuming that the reference would never be returned from another thread.\n\nThis resulted in a segmentation fault crash if Waker::wake_by_ref() was called on a waker returned from another thread due to it attempting to dereference a pointer that wasn't accessible from the main thread.", "methods": ["Used a NULL pointer dereference to cause a segmentation fault crash.", "Exploited a thread-local storage vulnerability.", "Executed a Waker::wake_by_ref() function to trigger the crash.", "Used a waker returned from another thread to cause the crash."]}
