This way, sessions in the admin tool theoretically could have been prolonged without any limit.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 versions 9.5.35 ELTS, 10.4.29, 11.5.11 that fix the problem described above.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Kien Hoang who reported this issue and to TYPO3 framework merger Ralf Zimmermann and TYPO3 security member Oliver Hader who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-005](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-005)", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in TYPO3's Admin Tool to maintain unauthorized access to the backend user interface.", "Used a privilege escalation technique to maintain access to the admin tool despite degraded or disabled user accounts.", "Failed to properly revoke sessions in the admin tool."]}
