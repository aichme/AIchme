Job publishes and file server replies are susceptible to replay attacks, which can result in an attacker replaying job publishes causing minions to run old jobs. File server replies can also be re-played. A sufficient craft attacker could gain root access on minion under certain scenarios.", "methods": ["Used replay attacks to execute old jobs on minions.", "Used replay attacks to execute file server replies.", "Gained root access on minion under certain scenarios."]}
