{"description": "### Impact\nChanges to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using [`allowed_idp_claims`](https://www.pomerium.com/reference/#allowed-idp-claims) as part of policy.  If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions.\n\n### Patches\nv0.15.6\n\n### Workarounds\n- Clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/pull/2724\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Pomerium](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium)\n* Email us at [security@pomerium.com](mailto:security@pomerium.com)\n", "methods": ["Incorrectly updated OIDC claims not reflected in policy evaluation.", "Incorrect authorization decisions due to outdated OIDC claims.", "Clearing data on `databroker` service to update OIDC claims."]}
