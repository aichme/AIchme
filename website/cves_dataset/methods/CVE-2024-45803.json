{"description": "### Summary\nA potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the `/wireui/button` endpoint, specifically through the `label` query parameter. Malicious actors could exploit this vulnerability by injecting JavaScript into the `label` parameter, leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the victim's browser.\n\n### Details\nThe `/wireui/button` endpoint dynamically renders button labels based on user-provided input via the `label` query parameter. Due to insufficient sanitization or escaping of this input, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript. The following URL demonstrates the vulnerability:\n\n```\nhttps://wireui.dev/wireui/button?label=Cancel&1%25%7ds8dk0%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3Ez1qt3=1\n```\n\nBy crafting such a request, an attacker can inject arbitrary code that will be executed by the browser when the endpoint is accessed.\n\n### Proof of Concept (PoC)\nTo demonstrate the vulnerability, visit the following URL:\n\n```\n/wireui/button?label=<script>alert(1)</script>\n```\n\nUpon loading the page, the injected JavaScript will execute, displaying an alert with the message \"1.\" This confirms the vulnerability and highlights that user input is not being properly escaped or sanitized.\n\n### Impact\nIf exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the affected website. This could lead to:\n\n- **Session Hijacking**: Stealing session cookies, tokens, or other sensitive information.\n- **User Impersonation**: Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users.\n- **Phishing**: Redirecting users to malicious websites.\n- **Content Manipulation**: Altering the appearance or behavior of the affected page to mislead users or execute further attacks.\n\nThe severity of this vulnerability depends on the context of where the affected component is used, but in all cases, it poses a significant risk to user security.", "methods": ["Injects malicious JavaScript into the `label` query parameter to execute arbitrary code in the victim's browser.", "Uses user-provided input to dynamically render button labels without proper sanitization or escaping.", "Executes arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the affected website.", "Steals session cookies, tokens, or other sensitive information through session hijacking.", "Performs unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users through user impersonation.", "Redirects users to malicious websites through phishing.", "Alters the appearance or behavior of the affected page to mislead users or execute further attacks through content manipulation."]}
