{"description": "### Impact\nAll TFLite operations that use quantization can be made to use unitialized values. [For example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/lite/kernels/depthwise_conv.cc#L198-L200):\n\n```cc\n    const auto* affine_quantization =\n        reinterpret_cast<TfLiteAffineQuantization*>(\n            filter->quantization.params);\n```\n\nThe issue stems from the fact that `quantization.params` is only valid if `quantization.type` is different that `kTfLiteNoQuantization`. However, these checks are missing in large parts of the code.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commits [537bc7c723439b9194a358f64d871dd326c18887](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/537bc7c723439b9194a358f64d871dd326c18887),\n[4a91f2069f7145aab6ba2d8cfe41be8a110c18a5](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/4a91f2069f7145aab6ba2d8cfe41be8a110c18a5) and [8933b8a21280696ab119b63263babdb54c298538](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8933b8a21280696ab119b63263babdb54c298538).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution \nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Missing input validation in TFLite operations that use quantization.", "Use of uninitialized value in TFLite operations that use quantization."]}
