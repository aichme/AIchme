{"description": "BigPanda Notifier Plugin 1.4.0 and earlier stores the BigPanda API key unencrypted in its global configuration file `BigpandaGlobalNotifier.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration. This API key can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system. Additionally, the global configuration form does not mask the API key, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture it.", "methods": ["Stores sensitive information in an unencrypted file.", "Stores sensitive information in a configuration file.", "Stores sensitive information in a file accessible to unauthorized users.", "Stores sensitive information in a file that is not masked."]}
