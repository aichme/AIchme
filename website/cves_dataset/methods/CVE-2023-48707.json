{"description": "### Impact\n**secretKey**, an important key for HMAC SHA256 authentication, was stored in the database in raw form.\n\nIf a malicious person somehow had access to the data in the database, they could use the key and secretKey for HMAC SHA256 authentication to send requests impersonating that person.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Shield v1.0.0-beta.8 or later.\n\nAfter upgrading, all existing secret keys must be encrypted.\nSee https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield/blob/develop/UPGRADING.md for details.\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n- https://codeigniter4.github.io/shield/references/authentication/hmac/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue or discussion in [codeigniter4/shield](https://github.com/codeigniter4/shield)\n* Email us at [security@codeigniter.com](mailto:security@codeigniter.com)\n", "methods": ["Stored sensitive information in cleartext.", "Used HMAC SHA256 authentication without proper key management.", "Impersonation via authentication bypass."]}
