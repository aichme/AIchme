{"description": "Apache Tomcat 5.5.x before 5.5.34, 6.x before 6.0.33, and 7.x before 7.0.19, when the MemoryUserDatabase is used, creates log entries containing passwords upon encountering errors in JMX user creation, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading a log file.\n\nThis issue was fixed in Apache Tomcat 7.0.17 but the release votes for the 7.0.17 and 7.0.18 release candidates did not pass. Therefore, users must download 7.0.19 to obtain a version that includes a fix.", "methods": ["Insertion of sensitive information into a log file in Apache Tomcat.", "Reading of log files for sensitive information."]}
