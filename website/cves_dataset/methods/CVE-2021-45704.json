{"description": "In the affected versions of the crate, AtomicBucket<T> unconditionally implements Send/Sync traits. Therefore, users can create a data race to the inner T: !Sync by using the AtomicBucket::data_with() API. Such data races can potentially cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was fixed in commit 8e6daab by adding appropriate Send/Sync bounds to the Send/Sync impl of struct Block<T> (which is a data type contained inside AtomicBucket<T>).", "methods": ["Created a data race to the inner T: !Sync by using the AtomicBucket::data_with() API.", "Caused memory corruption or other undefined behavior.", "Implemented Send/Sync traits without bounds.", "Failed to add appropriate Send/Sync bounds to the Send/Sync impl of struct Block<T>."]}
