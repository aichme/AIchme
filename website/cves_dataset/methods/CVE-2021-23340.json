An authenticated user can reach this function with a GET request at the following endpoint: /admin/reports/custom-report/download-csv?exportFile=&91;filename]. Since exportFile variable is not sanitized, an attacker can exploit a local file inclusion vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used Local File Inclusion to reach the downloadCsvAction function.", "Used a GET request to access the endpoint /admin/reports/custom-report/download-csv.", "Failed to sanitize the exportFile variable."]}
