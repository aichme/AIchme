{"description": "### Summary\nSecurity-sensitive parts of the *Python HTTP parser* retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies in order to protect against injection of additional requests. Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not handled consistently with processing of other malformed input.\n\n### Details\nThese problems are rooted in pattern matching protocol elements, previously improved by PR #3235 and GHSA-gfw2-4jvh-wgfg:\n\n1. The expression `HTTP/(\\d).(\\d)` lacked another backslash to clarify that the separator should be a literal dot, not just *any* Unicode code point (result: `HTTP/(\\d)\\.(\\d)`).\n\n2. The HTTP version was permitting Unicode digits, where only ASCII digits are standards-compliant.\n\n3. Distinct regular expressions for validating HTTP Method and Header field names were used - though both should (at least) apply the common restrictions of rfc9110 `token`.\n\n### PoC\n`GET / HTTP/1\u00f61`\n`GET / HTTP/1.?`\n`GET/: HTTP/1.1`\n`Content-Encoding?: chunked`\n\n### Impact\nPrimarily concerns running an aiohttp server without llhttp:\n 1. **behind a proxy**: Being more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on deployment environment, assist in request smuggling.\n 2. **directly accessible** or exposed behind proxies relaying malformed input: the unhandled exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities.\n\n-----\n\nPatch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/pull/8074/files", "methods": ["Used overly lenient HTTP parser to allow for injection of additional requests.", "Failed to handle exceptions consistently with processing of other malformed input.", "Permitted Unicode digits in HTTP version, which is not standards-compliant.", "Used distinct regular expressions for validating HTTP Method and Header field names, which should apply the same restrictions.", "Failed to handle request smuggling behind a proxy.", "Failed to handle unhandled exceptions, causing excessive resource consumption on the application server and/or its logging facilities."]}
