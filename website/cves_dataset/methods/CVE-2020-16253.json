{"description": "The PgHero gem through 2.6.0 for Ruby allows CSRF. PgHero normally uses the `protect_from_forgery` method from Rails to prevent CSRF. However, this defaults to `:null_session`, which has no effect on non-session based authentication methods. Thus the ruby gem is vulnerable with non-session based authentication methods like basic authentication.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable gem (PgHero) for CSRF attacks.", "Exploited non-session based authentication methods (basic authentication)."]}
