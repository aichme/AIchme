{"description": "Multiple stored XSS were found on different JSP files with unsanitized parameters in OpenMNS Horizon 31.0.8 and versions earlier than 32.0.2 on multiple platforms that allow an attacker to store on database and then load on JSPs or Angular templates. The solution is to upgrade to Meridian 2023.1.6, 2022.1.19, 2021.1.30, 2020.1.38 or Horizon 32.0.2 or newer. Meridian and Horizon installation instructions state that they are intended for installation within an organization's private networks and should not be directly accessible from the Internet. OpenNMS thanks\u00a0Jordi Miralles Comins for reporting this issue.\n", "methods": ["Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) in JSP files with unsanitized parameters.", "Stored XSS in Angular templates.", "Stored XSS in database.", "Stored XSS in multiple JSP files.", "Stored XSS in OpenNMS Horizon 31.0.8 and earlier versions.", "Stored XSS in OpenNMS Meridian 2023.1.6, 2022.1.19, 2021.1.30, 2020.1.38."]}
