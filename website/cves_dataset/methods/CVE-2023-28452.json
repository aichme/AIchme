{"description": "An issue was discovered in CoreDNS through 1.10.1. There is a vulnerability in DNS resolving software, which triggers a resolver to ignore valid responses, thus causing denial of service for normal resolution. In an exploit, the attacker could just forge a response targeting the source port of a vulnerable resolver without the need to guess the correct TXID.", "methods": ["Forged DNS responses to cause a denial of service for normal resolution.", "Exploited a vulnerability in DNS resolving software."]}
