{"description": "The socket2 crate has assumed `std::net::SocketAddrV4` and `std::net::SocketAddrV6` have the same memory layout as the system C representation `sockaddr`. It has simply casted the pointers to convert the socket addresses to the system representation. The standard library does not say anything about the memory layout, and this will cause invalid memory access if the standard library changes the implementation. No warnings or errors will be emitted once the change happens.\n", "methods": ["Invalid memory access due to incorrect assumption of memory layout.", "Incorrect use of pointer casting.", "Lack of input validation.", "Potential for undefined behavior due to library implementation changes."]}
