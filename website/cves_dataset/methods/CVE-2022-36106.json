As a result, a password reset link could be used to perform a password reset even if the default expiry time of two hours has been exceeded.\n\n### Solution\nUpdate to TYPO3 version 10.4.32 or 11.5.16 that fix the problem described above.\n\n### Credits\nThanks to Ingo Fabbri who reported this issue and to TYPO3 security team member Torben Hansen who fixed the issue.\n\n### References\n* [TYPO3-CORE-SA-2022-008](https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-core-sa-2022-008)", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in the password reset token expiration time for backend users.", "Used a password reset link to perform unauthorized actions.", "Leveraged a vulnerability in TYPO3 CMS to gain unauthorized access."]}
