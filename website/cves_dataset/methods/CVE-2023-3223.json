This may allow unauthorized users to cause remote Denial of Service (DoS) attack. If the server uses fileSizeThreshold to limit the file size, it's possible to bypass the limit by setting the file name in the request to null.", "methods": ["Attempt to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.", "Bypass a file size limit by setting the file name in the request to null."]}
