{"description": "### Impact\n\nSequelize 6.28.2 and prior has a dangerous feature where using parentheses in the attribute option would make Sequelize use the string as-is in the SQL\n\n```ts\nUser.findAll({\n  attributes: [\n    ['count(id)', 'count']\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nProduced\n\n```sql\nSELECT count(id) AS \"count\" FROM \"users\"\n```\n\n### Patches\n\nThis feature was deprecated in Sequelize 5, and using it prints a deprecation warning.\n\nThis issue has been patched in [`@sequelize/core@7.0.0.alpha-20`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15374) and [`sequelize@6.29.0`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15710). \n\nIn Sequelize 7, it now produces the following:\n\n```sql\nSELECT \"count(id)\" AS \"count\" FROM \"users\"\n```\n\nIn Sequelize 6, it throws an error explaining that we had to introduce a breaking change, and requires the user to explicitly opt-in to either the Sequelize 7 behavior (always escape) or the Sequelize 5 behavior (inline attributes that include `()` without escaping). See https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/pull/15710 for more information.\n\n### Mitigations\n\nDo not use user-provided content to build your list or attributes. If you do, make sure that attribute in question actually exists on your model by checking that it exists in the `rawAttributes` property of your model first.\n\n---\n\nA discussion thread about this issue is open at https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/discussions/15694\nCVE: CVE-2023-22578", "methods": ["Used user-provided content to build SQL queries.", "Failed to sanitize user-provided content in SQL queries.", "Used raw attributes in Sequelize to execute arbitrary SQL code.", "Failed to validate model attributes before using them in SQL queries."]}
