{"description": "The frontend rendering component in TYPO3 4.5.x before 4.5.39, 4.6.x through 6.2.x before 6.2.9, and 7.x before 7.0.2, allows remote attackers to change URLs to arbitrary domains.\n\nAn attacker could forge a request which modifies anchor only links on the homepage of a TYPO3 installation such that they point to arbitrary domains, if the configuration option `config.prefixLocalAnchors` is used with any possible value. TYPO3 versions 4.6.x and higher are only affected if the homepage is not a shortcut to a different page. As an additional pre-condition, URL rewriting must be enabled in the web server (which it typically is) when using extensions like realurl or cooluri.\n\nInstallations where `config.absRefPrefix` is additionally set to any value are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\nExample of affected configuration:\n\n```php\nconfig.absRefPrefix =\nconfig.prefixLocalAnchors = all \npage = PAGE \npage.10 = TEXT \npage.10.value = <a href=\"#skiplinks\">Skiplinks</a> \n.htaccess:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f \nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d \nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l \nRewriteRule .* index.php [L] \n```", "methods": ["Uses a vulnerability in the frontend rendering component to change URLs to arbitrary domains.", "Forges a request to modify anchor links on the homepage to point to arbitrary domains.", "Uses a configuration option (`config.prefixLocalAnchors`) to enable the vulnerability.", "Requires URL rewriting to be enabled in the web server.", "Uses a specific configuration (`config.absRefPrefix`) to prevent the vulnerability.", "Uses a RewriteRule in the .htaccess file to redirect requests to index.php."]}
