{"description": "### TL;DR\n\nThis vulnerability only affects you if you are using the `code` or `password-reset` auth method with the `auth.methods` option. It can only be successfully exploited under server configuration conditions outside of the attacker's control.\n\n----\n\n### Introduction\n\nUser enumeration is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers to confirm which users are registered in a Kirby installation. This information can be abused for social engineering attacks against users of the site or to find out the organizational structure of the company.\n\nUser enumeration attacks are performed by entering an existing and a non-existing user into the email address field of the login form. If the system returns a different response or behaves differently depending on whether the user exists, the attacker can enter unknown email addresses and use the different behavior as a clue for the (non-)existing user.\n\n### Impact\n\nUnder normal circumstances, entering an invalid email address results in a \"fake\" login code form that looks exactly like the one of an existing user (unless debugging is enabled). However, the code that handles the creation of a code challenge (for code-based login or password reset) didn't catch errors that occurred while the challenge request was processed:\n\n- If the challenge itself runs into an error (e.g. if the email could not be sent), attackers could tell existing users (where the challenge code is called) from non-existing users (where the challenge code is not called and therefore does not output an error).\n- If you are using the `user.login:failed` hook and any exception is thrown within the hook, attackers could see that the user does not exist.\n\nAs long as no error occurs during challenge creation and during the processing of the `user.login:failed` hook, your Kirby sites are *not* affected by this vulnerability.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problems have been patched in [Kirby 3.5.8.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.2), [Kirby 3.6.6.2](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.6.6.2), [Kirby 3.7.5.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.7.5.1) and [Kirby 3.8.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.8.1). Please update to one of these or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases) to fix the vulnerability.\n\nAll of the mentioned releases contain two patches for this vulnerability:\n\n- All errors that occur during the creation of an auth challenge (code-based login or password reset) are swallowed by the backend and only displayed to the user if debugging is enabled.\n- We added a new `auth.debug` option that can be enabled separately from the `debug` option. If disabled, auth errors are only printed to the PHP error log. This ensures that security-critical errors are only displayed if they are really necessary for debugging.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe recommend to update to one of the patch releases. If you cannot update immediately, you can work around the issue by setting the `auth.methods` option to `password`, which disables the code-based login and password reset forms.\n\nHowever please note that your site will still be vulnerable against [another user enumeration issue](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-c27j-76xg-6x4f) that was also fixed in the same patch releases.\n\n### Credits\n\nThanks to [Florian Merz](mailto:florian@hatchery.io) (@florianmrz) of [hatchery.io](https://www.hatchery.io/) for responsibly reporting the identified issue.", "methods": ["User enumeration through code-based login and password reset forms.", "Entered existing and non-existing user email addresses into the login form to observe different responses.", "Exploited errors that occurred during challenge creation to identify existing users.", "Exploited errors in the `user.login:failed` hook to identify non-existing users.", "Used debugging to display errors that were previously swallowed by the backend.", "Used the PHP error log to display auth errors when `auth.debug` is disabled.", "Used the `auth.methods` option to disable code-based login and password reset forms.", "Used the `password` option to disable code-based login and password reset forms.", "Exploited another user enumeration issue that was fixed in the same patch releases."]}
