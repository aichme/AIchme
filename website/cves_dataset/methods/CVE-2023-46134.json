{"description": "### Impact\nUsers hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to remote code execution allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to version 3.7.0 where the \"Custom Filter\" input is turned off by default. You can find out more information on how to turn it back on [here](https://github.com/man-group/dtale#custom-filter)\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only workaround for versions earlier than 3.7.0 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.\n\n### References\nSee \"Custom Filter\" [documentation](https://github.com/man-group/dtale#custom-filter)\n", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable web application (D-Tale) to execute arbitrary code.", "Executed malicious code on a server.", "Used a custom filter input to inject malicious code.", "Hosted the vulnerable application publicly.", "Allowed untrusted users to access the application."]}
