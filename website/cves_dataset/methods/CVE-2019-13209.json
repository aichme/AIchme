{"description": "Rancher 2 through 2.2.4 is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking attack that allows an exploiter to gain access to clusters managed by Rancher. The attack requires a victim to be logged into a Rancher server, and then to access a third-party site hosted by the exploiter. Once that is accomplished, the exploiter is able to execute commands against the cluster's Kubernetes API with the permissions and identity of the victim.", "methods": ["Used a third-party site to trick a victim into accessing a malicious site.", "Executed commands against a Kubernetes API with the victim's permissions and identity."]}
