A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed on the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending on the deserialization logic of these classes.", "methods": ["Exploited insecure deserialization in JBoss RichFaces.", "Triggers execution of deserialization methods in any serializable class.", "Remote code execution."]}
