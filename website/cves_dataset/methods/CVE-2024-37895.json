{"description": "### Summary\n\nIf an attacker can successfully authenticate through SSO/Access Code, they can obtain the real backend API Key by modifying the base URL to their own attack URL on the frontend and setting up a server-side request.\n\n### Details\n\nThe attack process is described above.\n\n![image](https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat/assets/36695271/df5e0c3c-af28-45c3-959f-182cc9d06680)\n\n### PoC\n\nFrontend:\n1. Pass basic authentication (SSO/Access Code).\n2. Set the Base URL to a private attack address.\n3. Configure the request method to be a server-side request.\n4. At the self-set attack address, retrieve the API Key information from the request headers.\n\nBackend:\n1. The LobeChat version allows setting the Base URL.\n2. There is no outbound traffic whitelist.\n\n### Impact\n\nAll community version LobeChat users using SSO/Access Code authentication, tested on version 0.162.13.", "methods": ["Used a malicious API to obtain sensitive information.", "Modified the base URL to redirect traffic to an attacker-controlled server.", "Used server-side requests to retrieve sensitive information.", "Exploited a configuration vulnerability in the LobeChat version 0.162.13.", "Used SSO/Access Code authentication to bypass authentication controls."]}
