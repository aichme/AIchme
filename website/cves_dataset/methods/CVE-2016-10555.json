{"description": "Affected versions of the `jwt-simple` package allow users to select what algorithm the server will use to verify a provided JWT. A malicious actor can use this behaviour to arbitrarily modify the contents of a JWT while still passing verification. For the common use case of the JWT, the end result is a complete authentication bypass with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 0.3.1 or later.\n\nAdditionally, be sure to always specify an algorithm in calls to `.decode()`.", "methods": ["Manipulated JWT contents to bypass authentication.", "Exploited a vulnerable library (jwt-simple) to achieve authentication bypass.", "Failed to specify an algorithm in JWT verification, allowing modification of JWT contents."]}
