{"description": "### Impact\nIf a list of quantized tensors is assigned to an attribute, the pywrap code fails to parse the tensor and returns a `nullptr`, which is not caught. An example can be seen in [`tf.compat.v1.extract_volume_patches`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/kernels/image/generate_box_proposals_op.cu.cc) by passing in quantized tensors as input `ksizes`.\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\na_input = np.array([1, -1], dtype= np.int32)\na_ksizes =  a_strides = tf.constant(dtype=tf.dtypes.qint16, value=[[1, 4], [5, 2]])\n\n\ntf.compat.v1.extract_volume_patches(input=a_input,ksizes=a_ksizes,strides=a_strides,padding='VALID')\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e9e95553e5411834d215e6770c81a83a3d0866ce](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e9e95553e5411834d215e6770c81a83a3d0866ce).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Pattarakrit Rattankul.\n", "methods": ["Attempted to exploit a vulnerability in TensorFlow via invalid attributes in `pywrap_tfe_src.cc`.", "Failed to parse a list of quantized tensors, resulting in a `nullptr` return value.", "Used a GitHub commit to patch the issue.", "Cherrypicked the patch on affected versions of TensorFlow (2.10.1, 2.9.3, 2.8.4).", "Failed to handle a specific input in the `tf.compat.v1.extract_volume_patches` function."]}
