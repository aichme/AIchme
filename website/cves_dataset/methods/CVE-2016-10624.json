{"description": "Affected versions of `selenium-chromedriver` insecurely download an executable over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \n\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the response and replace the executable with a malicious one, resulting in code execution on the system running `selenium-chromedriver`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo patch is currently available for this vulnerability, and the author has marked the package as deprecated.\n\nThe best mitigation is currently to avoid using this package, using a different package if available. \n\nAlternatively, the risk of exploitation can be reduced by ensuring that this package is not installed while connected to a public network. If the package is installed on a private network, the only people who can exploit this vulnerability are those who have compromised yo", "methods": ["Intercept and replace a legitimate executable with a malicious one.", "Execute code on a system.", "Download resources over an unencrypted HTTP connection."]}
