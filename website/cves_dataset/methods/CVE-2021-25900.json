{"description": "A bug in the SmallVec::insert_many method caused it to allocate a buffer that was smaller than needed. It then wrote past the end of the buffer, causing a buffer overflow and memory corruption on the heap. This bug was only triggered if the iterator passed to insert_many yielded more items than the lower bound returned from its size_hint method.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in smallvec 0.6.14 and 1.6.1, by ensuring that additional space is always reserved for each item inserted. The fix also simplified the implementation of insert_many to use less unsafe code, so it is easier to verify its correctness.", "methods": ["Triggered a buffer overflow in the SmallVec::insert_many method.", "Wrote past the end of a buffer, causing memory corruption on the heap.", "Allocated a buffer that was smaller than needed.", "Used an iterator that yielded more items than the lower bound returned from its size_hint method."]}
