{"description": "The Windows implementation of this crate relied on the behavior of std::char::from_u32_unchecked when its safety clause is violated. Even though this worked with Rust versions up to 1.42 (at least), that behavior could change with any new Rust version, possibly leading a security issue.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in version 2.0.0.", "methods": ["Leverages undefined behavior in Rust library.", "Uses behavior that may change with new library versions.", "Relies on specific library behavior for functionality."]}
