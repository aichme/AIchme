{"description": "A flaw was found in XNIO, specifically in the `notifyReadClosed` method. The issue revealed this method was logging a message to another expected end. This flaw allows an attacker to send flawed requests to a server, possibly causing log contention-related performance concerns or an unwanted disk fill-up. A fix for this issue is available on the `3.x` branch of the repository.", "methods": ["Exploited a flaw in the `notifyReadClosed` method of XNIO.", "Sent flawed requests to a server.", "Caused log contention-related performance concerns.", "Caused an unwanted disk fill-up."]}
