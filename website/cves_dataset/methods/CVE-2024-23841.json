{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs NPM package is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This vulnerability arises from improper handling of untrusted input when @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs performs server-side rendering of HTML pages. To fix this vulnerability, we implemented appropriate escaping to prevent javascript injection into rendered pages.\n\n### Patches\n\nTo fix this issue, please update to version 0.7.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds for this issue. Please update to version 0.7.0\n\n", "methods": ["Used a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the @apollo/experimental-apollo-client-nextjs NPM package.", "Injected malicious JavaScript into rendered pages.", "Failed to properly handle untrusted input."]}
