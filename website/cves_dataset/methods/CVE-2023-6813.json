{"description": "### Impact\nThe Auth0 WordPress plugin allows site administrators to opt-in to allowing the use of a `wle` parameter, which can be passed to the WordPress login page by end users. When this parameter is supplied using an expected value (which is randomly generated by the plugin, by default), the end user can fallback to using WordPress' native authentication behavior. (This is generally intended as an emergency fallback for administrators to still be able to access their dashboard in the event something goes wrong.)\n\nIn previous versions of the plugin, under specific conditions, this parameter could potentially accept an arbitrary string that would be improperly rendered, potentially allowing for a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on the login page.\n\n### Patches\nPlease upgrade to v4.6.1 of the plugin to resolve the issue.", "methods": ["Used Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to attack the login page.", "Used an arbitrary string to bypass authentication."]}
