This creates an unusual behavior, where _user_1_ can register with one email address and _user_2_ can register their username as _user_1_\u2019s email address. As a result, _user_1_ would be prevented to sign in Grafana, since _user_1_ password won\u2019t match with _users_2_ email address.\n\nThe CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.3 Moderate (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).\n\n### Impacted versions\n\nAll installations for Grafana versions <=9.x, <=8.x\n\n### Solutions and mitigations\n\nTo fully address CVE-2022-39229 please upgrade your Grafana instances. \nAppropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud).\n\n## Reporting security issues\n\nIf you think you have found a security vulnerability, please send a report to security@grafana.com.
