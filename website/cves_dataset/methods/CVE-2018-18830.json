{"description": "An issue was discovered in com\\mingsoft\\basic\\action\\web\\FileAction.java in MCMS 4.6.5. Since the upload interface does not verify the user login status, you can use this interface to upload files without setting a cookie. First, start an upload of JSP code with a .png filename, and then intercept the data packet. In the name parameter, change the suffix to jsp. In the response, the server returns the storage path of the file, which can be accessed to execute arbitrary JSP code.", "methods": ["Used a web interface to upload a file with a dangerous type (JSP code) without proper verification.", "Used a file upload interface to execute arbitrary code.", "Used a file upload interface to bypass authentication (no cookie required).", "Used a file upload interface to access arbitrary code execution.", "Used a file upload interface to access a storage path for malicious files."]}
