{"description": "Nullptr dereference when a null char is present in a proto symbol. The symbol is parsed incorrectly, leading to an unchecked call into the proto file's name during generation of the resulting error message. Since the symbol is incorrectly parsed, the file is nullptr. We recommend upgrading to version 3.15.0 or greater.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in Protocol Buffers.", "Used a null pointer dereference to cause a crash.", "Exploited a parsing error in a proto file.", "Used an unchecked call to a function.", "Exploited a version vulnerability in Protocol Buffers (version 3.15.0 or greater)."]}
