{"description": "### Impact\n\nBy creating a conflict when another user with more rights is currently editing a page, it is possible to execute JavaScript snippets on the side of the other user, which compromises the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation.\n\nTo reproduce on a XWiki instance, a user with admin rights needs to edit a document without saving right away.\nThen, as another user without any other right than edit on the specific document, change the whole content to `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.\nWhen the admin user then saves the document, a conflict popup appears. If they select \"Fix each conflict individually\" and see an alert displaying \"XSS\", then the instance is vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been patched in XWiki 15.10.8 and 16.3.0RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nWe're not aware of any workaround except upgrading.\n\n### References\n\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21626\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/821d43ec45e67d45a6735a0717b9b77fffc1cd9f\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in XWiki Platform to execute JavaScript snippets on the side of another user.", "Used a conflict resolution scenario to inject malicious code.", "Executed JavaScript code on the client-side."]}
