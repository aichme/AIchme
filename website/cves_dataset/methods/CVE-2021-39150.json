{"description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream with a Java runtime version 14 to 8. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nIf you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.18.\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39150](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39150.html).\n\n### Credits\nLai Han of NSFOCUS security team found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n", "methods": ["Manipulated input stream to access data from an arbitrary URL referencing a resource in an intranet or the local host.", "Leveraged a Java runtime version 14 to 8 to exploit the vulnerability.", "Failed to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.", "Used a default blacklist of the Security Framework with a version less than 1.4.18."]}
