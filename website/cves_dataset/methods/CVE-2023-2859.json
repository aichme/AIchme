This could result in an attack on an admin who edits the folder, as the payload could execute upon the admin's interaction with the folder. This attack could potentially allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the admin's system or steal sensitive information, or it could force admin to get redirected to a website controlled by the attacker.", "methods": ["Renamed a folder with a payload containing malicious code to inject it into the system.", "Executed malicious code upon admin interaction with the folder.", "Gained unauthorized access to the admin's system or stole sensitive information.", "Redirected the admin to a website controlled by the attacker."]}
