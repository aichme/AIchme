{"description": "jenkins-email-ext before version 2.57.1 is vulnerable to an Information Exposure. The Email Extension Plugins is able to send emails to a dynamically created list of users based on the changelogs, like authors of SCM changes since the last successful build. This could in some cases result in emails being sent to people who have no user account in Jenkins, and in rare cases even people who were not involved in whatever project was being built, due to some mapping based on the local-part of email addresses.", "methods": ["Sent emails to non-existent users by exploiting the Email Extension Plugin in Jenkins.", "Used Email Extension Plugin to send emails to dynamically created lists of users.", "Exploited the Email Extension Plugin's ability to send emails to users without a Jenkins account."]}
