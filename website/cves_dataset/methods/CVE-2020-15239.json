{"description": "### Impact\n\n#### Information Disclosure\n\nWhen the GET method is attacked, attackers can read files which have a `.data` suffix and which are accompanied by a JSON file with the `.meta` suffix. This can lead to Information Disclosure and in some shared-hosting scenarios also to circumvention of authentication or other limitations on the outbound (GET) traffic.\n\nFor example, in a scenario where a single server has multiple instances of the application running (with separate DATA_ROOT settings), an attacker who has knowledge about the directory structure is able to read files from any other instance to which the process has read access.\n\nIf instances have individual authentication (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy, source IP based filtering) or other restrictions (such as quotas), attackers may circumvent those limits in such a scenario by using the Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other instances.\n\n#### File Write\n\nIf the associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is malicious, they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which are written are constrained to have the `.meta` and the `.data` suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the JSON with the Content-Type of the original request and the `.data` file will contain the payload.\n\n### Patches\n\nPR #12 fixes the issue. The PR has been merged into version 0.4.0 and 0.4.0 has been released and pushed to PyPI. Users are advised to upgrade immediately.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Apache can apparently be configured to filter such malicious paths when reverse-proxying. \n- There are no other workarounds known.\n\n### References\n\n- [Pull Request #12](https://github.com/horazont/xmpp-http-upload/pull/12)", "methods": ["Discloses information via crafted GET requests.", "Discloses information via crafted PUT requests.", "Writes files outside the DATA_ROOT via crafted PUT requests.", "Circumvents authentication or other limitations on outbound traffic.", "Circumvents quotas or other restrictions on outbound traffic.", "Uses directory traversal to read files from other instances.", "Uses directory traversal to write files outside the DATA_ROOT."]}
