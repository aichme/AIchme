{"description": "HashiCorp\u2019s go-getter library can be coerced into executing Git update on an existing maliciously modified Git Configuration, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. When go-getter is performing a Git operation, go-getter will try to clone the given repository in a specified destination. Cloning initializes a git config to the provided destination and if the repository needs to get updated go-getter will pull the new changes .\n\nAn attacker may alter the Git config after the cloning step to set an arbitrary Git configuration to achieve code execution.", "methods": ["Manipulated Git configuration to execute arbitrary code.", "Used Git config to achieve code execution.", "Manipulated Git repository to execute arbitrary code.", "Executed arbitrary code via Git update."]}
