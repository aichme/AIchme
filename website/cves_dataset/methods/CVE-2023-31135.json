{"description": "### Impact\nExisting Dgraph audit logs are vulnerable to brute force attacks due to nonce collisions.  All audit logs generated by versions of Dgraph <v23.0.0 are affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue was patched in https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/pull/8323.  Dgraph users should upgrade to v23.0.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nStore existing audit logs in a secure location.  For extra security, encrypt using a tool like `gpg`.\n\n### References\nSee https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/pull/8323 for more context on the vulnerability.", "methods": ["Used brute force attacks on audit logs.", "Stored sensitive data in an insecure location.", "Failed to implement encryption for audit logs.", "Failed to patch vulnerable versions of Dgraph."]}
