{"description": "### Impact\nThe create action is vulnerable to a CSRF attack, allowing script and thus remote code execution when targeting a user with script/programming right, thus compromising the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. To reproduce, the XWiki syntax `[[image:path:/xwiki/bin/create/Foo/WebHome?template=&parent=Main.WebHome&title=$services.logging.getLogger(%22foo%22).error(%22Script%20executed!%22)]]` can be added to any place that supports XWiki syntax like a comment. When a user with script right views this image and a log message `ERROR foo - Script executed!` appears in the log, the XWiki installation is vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in XWiki 14.10.9 and 15.4RC1 by requiring a CSRF token for the actual page creation.\n\n### Workarounds\nThere are no known workarounds.\n\n### References\n* https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20849\n* https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/4b20528808d0c311290b0d9ab2cfc44063380ef7", "methods": ["Used a CSRF attack to execute scripts and achieve RCE.", "Executed scripts with script/programming right.", "Used XWiki syntax to inject malicious code.", "Leveraged a log message to verify vulnerability."]}
