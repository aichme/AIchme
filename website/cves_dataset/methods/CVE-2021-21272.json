{"description": "### Impact\nThe directory support (#55) allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links.\n\nA well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. \n\nPrecisely, the following users of the affected versions are impacted\n- `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`.\n- Go programs, which invokes `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been patched by the PR linked with this advisory. Users should upgrade their `oras` CLI and packages to `0.9.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\nFor `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider.\n\nFor `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.\n\n### References\n- [Zip Slip](https://github.com/snyk/zip-slip-vulnerability)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/deislabs/oras)\n* Email the [list of maintainers](https://github.com/deislabs/oras/blob/main/MAINTAINERS)", "methods": ["Used a zip slip directory exploit in github.com/deislabs/oras.", "Exploited symbolic links and hard links to write or overwrite files outside of the user-specified directory.", "Used a vulnerability in the directory support (#55) to extract tarballs to the user-specified directory."]}
