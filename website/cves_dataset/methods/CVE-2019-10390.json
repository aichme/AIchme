{"description": "Jenkins Splunk Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection. This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.\n\nThe affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.", "methods": ["Used a form validation HTTP endpoint to execute arbitrary code.", "Used AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to execute code.", "Executed code on the Jenkins controller with Overall/Read access."]}
