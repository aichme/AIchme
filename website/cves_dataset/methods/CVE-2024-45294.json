{"description": "### Impact\nXSLT transforms performed by various components are vulnerable to XML external entity injections. A processed XML file with a malicious DTD tag ( `<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM \"/etc/passwd\"> ]>` could produce XML containing data from the host system. This impacts use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used to within a host where external clients can submit XML.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in release 6.3.23\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n[MITRE CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)\n[OWASP XML External Entity Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#transformerfactory)\n", "methods": ["Used XML External Entity (XXE) injection to inject malicious DTD tags.", "Used XXE to produce XML containing data from the host system.", "Used XXE to impact use cases where org.hl7.fhir.core is being used in a host with external clients submitting XML."]}
