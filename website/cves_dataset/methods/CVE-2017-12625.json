{"description": "Apache Hive 2.1.x before 2.1.2, 2.2.x before 2.2.1, and 2.3.x before 2.3.1 expose an interface through which masking policies can be defined on tables or views, e.g., using Apache Ranger. When a view is created over a given table, the policy enforcement does not happen correctly on the table for masked columns.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable interface to define masking policies on tables or views.", "Failed to enforce policy enforcement on masked columns.", "Created a view over a table without proper policy enforcement."]}
