{"description": "### Impact\n\nWhen invoking a capability with a chain depth of 2, i.e., it is delegated directly from the root capability, the `expires` property is not properly checked against the current date or other `date` param.  This can allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.  A zcap still cannot be invoked without being able to use the associated private key material.\n\n### Patches\n\n`@digitalbazaar/zcap` v9.0.1 fixes expiration checking.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nA zcap could be revoked at any time.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/digitalbazaar/zcap/pull/82", "methods": ["Incomplete expiration checks in capability chains allow invocations outside of the original intended time period.", "Capability delegation without proper expiration checks.", "Capability revocation as a workaround."]}
