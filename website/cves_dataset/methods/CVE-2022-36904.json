{"description": "Jenkins Repository Connector Plugin 2.2.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.\n\nThis allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system. A sequence of requests can be used to effectively list the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in the Jenkins Repository Connector Plugin to bypass permission checks.", "Used a sequence of requests to list the Jenkins controller file system.", "Exploited a lack of permission checks in form validation."]}
