We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou from the Secure Systems Lab (SSL) at Brown University.\n", "methods": ["Overflow in `FusedResizeAndPadConv2D` function.", "Large tensor shape used to overflow the function.", "Integer overflow in `tf.constant` with value 1879048192."]}
