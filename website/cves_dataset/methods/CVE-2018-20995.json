{"description": "Affected versions of this crate did not properly update the head and tail of the deque when inserting and removing elements from the front if, before insertion or removal, the tail of the deque was in the mirrored memory region, and if, after insertion or removal, the head of the deque is exactly at the beginning of the mirrored memory region.\n\nAn attacker that controls both element insertion and removal into the deque could put it in a corrupted state. Once the deque enters such an state, its head and tail are corrupted, but in bounds of the allocated memory. This can result in partial reads and writes, reads of uninitialized memory, reads of memory containing previously dropped objects, etc. An attacker could exploit this to alter program execution.\n\nThe flaw was corrected by properly updating the head and tail of the deque in this case.", "methods": ["Manipulated memory to corrupt a data structure (deque).", "Exploited memory corruption to alter program execution.", "Executed arbitrary code through memory corruption."]}
