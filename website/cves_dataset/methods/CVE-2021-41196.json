{"description": "### Impact\nThe Keras pooling layers can trigger a segfault if the size of the pool is 0 or if a dimension is negative: \n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\npool_size = [2, 2, 0]\nlayer = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D(strides=1, pool_size=pool_size)\ninput_tensor = tf.random.uniform([3, 4, 10, 11, 12], dtype=tf.float32)\nres = layer(input_tensor)\n```\n\nThis is due to the TensorFlow's implementation of pooling operations where the values in the sliding window are not checked to be strictly positive.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [12b1ff82b3f26ff8de17e58703231d5a02ef1b8b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/12b1ff82b3f26ff8de17e58703231d5a02ef1b8b) (merging [#51975](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51975)).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution \nThis vulnerability has been reported externally via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/51936).\n", "methods": ["Triggered a segmentation fault in the `max_pool3d` function by passing a size argument of 0 or a negative value.", "Exploited a vulnerability in TensorFlow's implementation of pooling operations where values in the sliding window are not checked to be strictly positive."]}
