{"description": "# Description\n\nWhen using the filesystem loader to load templates for which the name is a user input, it is possible to use the `source` or `include` statement to read arbitrary files from outside the templates directory when using a namespace like `@somewhere/../some.file` (in such a case, validation is bypassed).\n\n# Resolution\n\nWe fixed validation for such template names.\n\nEven if the 1.x branch is not maintained anymore, a new version has been released.\n\n# Credits\n\nWe would like to thank Dariusz Tytko for reporting the issue and Fabien Potencier for fixing the issue.\n", "methods": ["Bypassed validation for template names using `@somewhere/../some.file` syntax.", "Loaded templates from outside a configured directory using the filesystem loader."]}
