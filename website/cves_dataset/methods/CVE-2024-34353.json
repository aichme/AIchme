{"description": "### Introduction\n\nIn Matrix, the server-side *key backup* stores encrypted copies of Matrix message keys. This facilitates key sharing between a user's devices and provides a redundant copy in case all devices are lost. The key backup uses asymmetric cryptography, with each server-side key backup assigned a unique public-private key pair.\n\n### Impact\n\nDue to a logic bug introduced in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2961/commits/71136e44c03c79f80d6d1a2446673bc4d53a2067, the matrix-sdk-crypto crate version 0.7.0 will sometimes log the private part of the backup key pair to Rust debug logs (using the `tracing` crate).\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been resolved in matrix-sdk-crypto [version 0.7.1](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-crypto-0.7.1).\n\n### Workarounds\nNone.\n\n### References\n\n- [crates.io release](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto/0.7.1)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security at matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).\n", "methods": ["Leaked sensitive information (private key) via log exposure.", "Used a logic bug to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information."]}
