{"description": "### Impact\nJsrsasign can verify RSA-PSS signature which value can expressed as BigInteger. When there is a valid RSA-PSS signature value, this vulnerability is also accept value with prepending zeros as a valid signature.\n\n- If you are not use RSA-PSS signature validation, this vulnerability is not affected. \n- Risk to accept a forged or crafted message to be signed is low.\n- Risk to raise memory corruption is low since jsrsasign uses BigInteger class.\n\n### Patches\nUsers using RSA-PSS signature validation should upgrade to 8.0.17.\n\n### Workarounds\nReject RSA-PSS signatures with unnecessary prepending zeros.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/security/advisories/GHSA-q3gh-5r98-j4h3\n[https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/438](https://github.com/kjur/jsrsasign/issues/438)\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-14968\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-14968\nhttps://vuldb.com/?id.157125\nhttps://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/api/symbols/RSAKey.html#.verifyWithMessageHashPSS\n\n", "methods": ["Accepts forged or crafted messages to be signed.", "Accepts RSA-PSS signatures with prepending zeros as valid.", "Rejects RSA-PSS signatures with unnecessary prepending zeros."]}
