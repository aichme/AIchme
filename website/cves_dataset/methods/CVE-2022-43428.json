{"description": "Jenkins Compuware Topaz for Total Test Plugin 2.4.8 and earlier implements an agent/controller message that does not limit where it can be executed, allowing attackers able to control agent processes to obtain the values of Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process.\n\nThese vulnerabilities are only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier. See the [LTS upgrade guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/upgrade-guide/2.303/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-303-3).", "methods": ["Exploited agent-to-controller security bypass in Jenkins Compuware Topaz for Total Test Plugin.", "Obtained Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process.", "Exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier."]}
