An attacker can use this flaw to construct a malicious request to bypass validation and access other URLs and potentially sensitive information within the domain or possibly conduct further attacks. This flaw affects any client that utilizes a wildcard in the Valid Redirect URIs field.\n\n#### Acknowledgements:\nSpecial thanks to Axel Flamcourt for reporting this issue and helping us improve our project.", "methods": ["Attempted URL manipulation to bypass validation.", "Attempted to access unauthorized URLs within the domain.", "Conducted further attacks."]}
