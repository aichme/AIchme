{"description": "In Apache Linkis <=1.3.1, due to the lack of effective filtering of parameters, an attacker configuring malicious Mysql JDBC parameters in JDBC EngineConn Module will trigger a deserialization vulnerability and eventually lead to remote code execution. Therefore, the parameters in the Mysql JDBC URL should be blacklisted. Users should upgrade their version of Linkis to version 1.3.2.", "methods": ["Used deserialization vulnerability in Apache Linkis JDBC EngineConn.", "Triggered remote code execution."]}
