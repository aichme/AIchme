This only affects forms using the \"Forms\" feature and not just _any_ arbitrary form. This does not affect the control panel.\n\n### Patches\nIt has been patched in 3.4.13 and 4.33.0.\n", "methods": ["Used front-end form uploads to upload PHP files disguised as images.", "Used PHP files to execute code.", "Used a vulnerability in the \"Forms\" feature to bypass mime validation rules."]}
