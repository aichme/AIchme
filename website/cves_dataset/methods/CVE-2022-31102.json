{"description": "### Impact\n\nAll versions of Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser. \n\nThis vulnerability only affects Argo CD instances which have SSO enabled.\n\nThe exploit also assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key, 2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link.\n\nThe vulnerability is classified as low severity, because access to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could not otherwise gain using the encryption key.\n\n### Patches\n\nA patch for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions:\n\n* v2.4.5\n* v2.3.6\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround besides upgrading.\n\n### Credits\n\nDisclosed by ADA Logics in a security audit of the Argo project sponsored by CNCF and facilitated by OSTIF. Thanks to Adam Korczynski and David Korczynski for their work on the audit.\n\n### For more information\n\n* Open an issue in [the Argo CD issue tracker](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/discussions)\n* Join us on [Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack) in channel #argo-cd\n", "methods": ["Injects arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page in a victim's browser.", "Impersonates the victim.", "Access to the API server's encryption key grants a high level of access.", "Adds a cookie to the victim's browser.", "Convinces the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback` link.", "Exploits a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug."]}
