{"description": "### Impact\n\nA remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to passport-saml 3.2.2 or newer. The issue was also present in the beta releases of `node-saml` before v4.0.0-beta.5.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisable SAML authentication.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open a discussion in the [node-saml repo](https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml/discussions)\n\n### Credits\n\n* Felix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero\n", "methods": ["Bypasses SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml.", "Uses an arbitrary IDP signed XML element to bypass authentication.", "Triggers generation of a signed message without access to a valid user.", "Uses a vulnerability in passport-saml 3.2.1 and earlier.", "Uses a vulnerability in node-saml before v4.0.0-beta.5."]}
