{"description": "### Impact\nIf a user does not provide a valid padding value to `tf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPartOp`, then the code triggers a null pointer dereference (if input is empty) or produces invalid behavior, ignoring all values after the first:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.MatrixDiagPartV2(\n  input=tf.ones(2,dtype=tf.int32),\n  k=tf.ones(2,dtype=tf.int32),\n  padding_value=[])\n```\n\nAlthough this example is given for `MatrixDiagPartV2`, all versions of the operation are affected.\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/matrix_diag_op.cc#L89) reads the first value from a tensor buffer without first checking that the tensor has values to read from.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [482da92095c4d48f8784b1f00dda4f81c28d2988](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/482da92095c4d48f8784b1f00dda4f81c28d2988).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Null pointer dereference in `MatrixDiagPartOp` to trigger a null pointer dereference or produce invalid behavior.", "Used GitHub commit to patch the issue.", "Used GitHub to track the fix in TensorFlow 2.6.0 and cherrypick the commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4."]}
