{"description": "### Description\n\nSessionStrategyListener does not always migrate the session after a successful login. It only migrate the session when the logged-in user identifier changes. In some use cases, the user identifier doesn't change between the verification phase and the successful login, while the token itself changes from one type (partially-authenticated) to another (fully-authenticated). When this happens, the session id should be regenerated to prevent possible session fixations.\n\n### Resolution\n\nSymfony now checks the type of the token in addition to the user identifier before deciding whether the session id should be regenerated.\n\nThe patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/dc356499d5ceb86f7cf2b4c7f032eca97061ed74) for branch 5.4.\n\n### Credits\n\nWe would like to thank Robert Meijers for reporting the issue and providing the fix.", "methods": ["Used session fixation vulnerability to maintain persistence.", "Failed to regenerate session ID after successful login.", "Failed to migrate session after successful login.", "Failed to check token type before deciding to regenerate session ID."]}
