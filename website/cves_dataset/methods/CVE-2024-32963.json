{"description": "### Summary\nParameter tampering is a vulnerability where an attacker has the ability to manipulate parameter values in the HTTP requests.\n\n### Details\nThe attacker is able to change the parameter values in the body and successfully impersonate another user. In this case, the attacker created a playlist, added song, posted arbitrary comment, set the playlist to be public, and put the admin as the owner of the playlist.\n\n### Impact\nEach known user is impacted. An attacker can obtain the ownerId from shared playlist information, meaning every user who has shared a playlist is also impacted, as they can be impersonated.", "methods": ["Manipulated HTTP request parameters to impersonate another user.", "Changed parameter values in the HTTP request body.", "Impersonated a user by manipulating parameter values.", "Obtained sensitive information from shared playlist information.", "Used shared playlist information to impersonate a user."]}
