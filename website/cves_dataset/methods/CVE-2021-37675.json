{"description": "### Impact\nMost implementations of convolution operators in TensorFlow are affected by a division by 0 vulnerability where an attacker can trigger a denial of service via a crash:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior()\ntf.raw_ops.Conv2D(\n  input = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32),\n  filter = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=tf.float32),\n  strides = [1, 1, 1, 1],\n  padding = \"SAME\")\n```\n\nThe shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/framework/common_shape_fns.cc#L577) is missing several validations before doing divisions and modulo operations.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8a793b5d7f59e37ac7f3cd0954a750a2fe76bad4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8a793b5d7f59e37ac7f3cd0954a750a2fe76bad4).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security.", "methods": ["Missing input validation in shape inference implementation.", "Division by 0 in most convolution operators."]}
