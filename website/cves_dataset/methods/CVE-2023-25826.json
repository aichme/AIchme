{"description": "Due to insufficient validation of parameters passed to the legacy HTTP query API, it is possible to inject crafted OS commands into multiple parameters and execute malicious code on the OpenTSDB host system. This exploit exists due to an incomplete fix that was made when this vulnerability was previously disclosed as CVE-2020-35476. Regex validation that was implemented to restrict allowed input to the query API does not work as intended, allowing crafted commands to bypass validation.\n\n", "methods": ["Command injection via crafted OS commands in HTTP query API parameters.", "Bypass of input validation via regex.", "Execution of malicious code on the OpenTSDB host system."]}
