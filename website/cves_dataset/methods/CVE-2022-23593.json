{"description": "### Impact\nThe [`simplifyBroadcast` function in the MLIR-TFRT infrastructure in TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/274df9b02330b790aa8de1cee164b70f72b9b244/tensorflow/compiler/mlir/tfrt/jit/transforms/tf_cpurt_symbolic_shape_optimization.cc#L149-L205) is vulnerable to a segfault (hence, denial of service), if called with scalar shapes.\n\n```cc \n  size_t maxRank = 0;\n  for (auto shape : llvm::enumerate(shapes)) {\n    auto found_shape = analysis.dimensionsForShapeTensor(shape.value());\n    if (!found_shape) return {};\n    shapes_found.push_back(*found_shape);\n    maxRank = std::max(maxRank, found_shape->size());\n  }   \n\n  SmallVector<const ShapeComponentAnalysis::SymbolicDimension*>\n      joined_dimensions(maxRank);\n```\n\nIf all shapes are scalar, then `maxRank` is 0, so we build an empty `SmallVector`.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [35f0fabb4c178253a964d7aabdbb15c6a398b69a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/35f0fabb4c178253a964d7aabdbb15c6a398b69a).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. This is the only affected version.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["None"]}
