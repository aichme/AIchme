{"description": "### Summary\nAn attacker can send a specially crafted POST (multipart/form-data) request. When the aiohttp server processes it, the server will enter an infinite loop and be unable to process any further requests.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can stop the application from serving requests after sending a single request.\n\n-------\n\nFor anyone needing to patch older versions of aiohttp, the minimum diff needed to resolve the issue is (located in `_read_chunk_from_length()`):\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/aiohttp/multipart.py b/aiohttp/multipart.py\nindex 227be605c..71fc2654a 100644\n--- a/aiohttp/multipart.py\n+++ b/aiohttp/multipart.py\n@@ -338,6 +338,8 @@ class BodyPartReader:\n         assert self._length is not None, \"Content-Length required for chunked read\"\n         chunk_size = min(size, self._length - self._read_bytes)\n         chunk = await self._content.read(chunk_size)\n+        if self._content.at_eof():\n+            self._at_eof = True\n         return chunk\n \n     async def _read_chunk_from_stream(self, size: int) -> bytes:\n```\n\nThis does however introduce some very minor issues with handling form data.
