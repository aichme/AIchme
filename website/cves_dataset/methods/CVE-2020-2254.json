{"description": "Blue Ocean Plugin 1.23.2 and earlier provides an undocumented feature flag, `blueocean.features.GIT_READ_SAVE_TYPE`, that when set to the value `clone` allows an attacker with Item/Configure or Item/Create permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nBlue Ocean Plugin 1.23.3 no longer includes this feature and redirects existing usage to a safer alternative.", "methods": ["Used an undocumented feature flag to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.", "Leveraged Item/Configure or Item/Create permission to access sensitive data.", "Exploited a path traversal vulnerability in the Blue Ocean Plugin."]}
