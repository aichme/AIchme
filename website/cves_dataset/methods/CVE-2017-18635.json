{"description": "Versions of `@novnc/novnc` prior to 0.6.2 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to validate input from the remote VNC server such as the VNC server name. This allows an attacker in control of the remote server to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the noVNC web page. It affects any users of `include/ui.js` and users of `vnc_auto.html` and `vnc.html`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpgrade to version 0.6.2 or later.", "methods": ["Injects malicious JavaScript code via unvalidated input from a remote VNC server.", "Executes arbitrary JavaScript in the noVNC web page."]}
