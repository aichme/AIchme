{"description": "### Impact\n\nIn Node.js mixme v0.5.0, an attacker can add or alter properties of an object via 'proto' through the mutate() and merge() functions. The polluted attribute will be directly assigned to every object in the program. This will put the availability of the program at risk causing a potential denial of service (DoS).\n\n### Patches\nThe problem is corrected starting with version 0.5.1.\n\n### References\nIssue: https://github.com/adaltas/node-mixme/issues/1\nCommit: https://github.com/adaltas/node-mixme/commit/cfd5fbfc32368bcf7e06d1c5985ea60e34cd4028\n\n", "methods": ["Used a potentially dangerous function in mixme to add or alter properties of an object via 'proto' through the mutate() and merge() functions.", "Exploited the polluted attribute to cause a potential denial of service (DoS)."]}
