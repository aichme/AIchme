{"description": "A vulnerability was discovered in Rancher versions 2.0 through the aforementioned fixed versions, where users were granted access to resources regardless of the resource's API group. For example Rancher should have allowed users access to `apps.catalog.cattle.io`, but instead incorrectly gave access to `apps.*`. Resource affected include: \n\n**Downstream clusters:**\napiservices\nclusters\nclusterrepos\npersistentvolumes\nstorageclasses\n\n**Rancher management cluster**\napprevisions\napps\ncatalogtemplates\ncatalogtemplateversions\nclusteralertgroups\nclusteralertrules\nclustercatalogs\nclusterloggings\nclustermonitorgraphs\nclusterregistrationtokens\nclusterroletemplatebindings\nclusterscans\netcdbackups\nnodepools\nnodes\nnotifiers\npipelineexecutions\npipelines\npipelinesettings\npodsecuritypolicytemplateprojectbindings\nprojectalertgroups\nprojectalertrules\nprojectcatalogs\nprojectloggings\nprojectmonitorgraphs\nprojectroletemplatebindings\nprojects\nsecrets\nsourcecodeproviderconfigs\n\nThere is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.", "methods": ["Misconfigured RBAC permissions in Kubernetes.", "Incorrectly granted access to resources across multiple API groups.", "Lack of proper access control to downstream clusters.", "Lack of proper access control to Rancher management cluster resources.", "Excessive privileges granted to users."]}
