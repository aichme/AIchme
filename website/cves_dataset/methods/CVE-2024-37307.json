{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe output of `cilium-bugtool` can contain sensitive data when the tool is run (with the `--envoy-dump` flag set) against Cilium deployments with the Envoy proxy enabled.\n\nUsers of the following features are affected:\n\n- [TLS inspection](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/tls-visibility/#gs-tls-inspection)\n- [Ingress with TLS termination](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/servicemesh/tls-termination/#gs-ingress-tls)\n- [Gateway API with TLS termination](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/servicemesh/gateway-api/https/)\n- [Kafka network policies with API key filtering](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#kafka-beta)\n\nThe sensitive data includes:\n\n- The CA certificate, certificate chain, and private key used by Cilium HTTP Network Policies, and when using Ingress/Gateway API\n- The API keys used in Kafka-related network policy\n\n`cilium-bugtool` is a debugging tool that is typically invoked manually and does not run during the normal operation of a Cilium cluster.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n- Cilium v1.13 between v1.13.0 and v1.13.16 inclusive\n- Cilium v1.14 between v1.14.0 and v1.14.11 inclusive\n- Cilium v1.15 between v1.15.0 and v1.15.5 inclusive\n\nThis issue has been patched in:\n\n- Cilium v1.15.6\n- Cilium v1.14.12\n- Cilium v1.13.17\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is no workaround to this issue.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nThe Cilium community has worked together with members of Isovalent to prepare these mitigations. Special thanks to @sayboras for their work on triaging and remediating this issue.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please reach out on [Slack](https://docs.cilium.io/en/latest/community/community/#slack).\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at [security@cilium.io](mailto:security@cilium.io). This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority.", "methods": ["Leaks sensitive information through the output of `cilium-bugtool` when run with the `--envoy-dump` flag.", "Uses TLS inspection, Ingress with TLS termination, Gateway API with TLS termination, and Kafka network policies with API key filtering.", "Exposes CA certificate, certificate chain, and private key used by Cilium HTTP Network Policies and Ingress/Gateway API.", "Exposes API keys used in Kafka-related network policy."]}
