{"description": "The llhttp parser in the http module in Node.js does not strictly use the CRLF sequence to delimit HTTP requests. The LF character (without CR) is sufficient to delimit HTTP header fields in the lihttp parser. According to RFC7230 section 3, only the CRLF sequence should delimit each header-field. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling (HRS).", "methods": ["Uses HTTP Request Smuggling via Improper Delimiting of Header Fields.", "Exploits a vulnerability in the http module in Node.js.", "Leverages a weakness in the lihttp parser."]}
