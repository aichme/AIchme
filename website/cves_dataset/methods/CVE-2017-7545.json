A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server and, potentially, perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks.\n\nThe related jbpm-designer project removed use of jbpmmigration completely as a result.", "methods": ["Used XXE attacks to read files accessible to the user running the application server.", "Used XXE attacks to perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks."]}
