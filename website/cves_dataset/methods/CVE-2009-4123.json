{"description": "A security problem involving peer certificate verification was found where failed verification silently did nothing, making affected applications vulnerable to attackers.

Attackers could also penetrate client-validated SSL server applications with a dummy certificate.\n", "methods": ["Impersonate a trusted entity to establish a secure connection.", "Bypass client-side security controls."]}
