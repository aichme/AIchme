{"description": "The Elliptic package before version 6.5.3 for Node.js allows ECDSA signature malleability via variations in encoding, leading '\\0' bytes, or integer overflows. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single canonical signature.", "methods": ["Used Elliptic package with a vulnerable version (before 6.5.3) for ECDSA signature malleability.", "Exploited variations in encoding.", "Exploited '\\0' bytes.", "Exploited integer overflows."]}
