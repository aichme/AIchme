{"description": "### Impact\nThe translation value with text including \u201c%s\u201d (from \u201c%suggest%) is parsed by sprintf() even though it\u2019s supposed to be output literally to the user.\n\nThe translations may be accessible by a user with comparatively lower overall access (as the translation permission cannot be scoped to certain \u201cmodules\u201d) and a skilled attacker might be able to exploit the parsing of the translation string in the dialog box.\n\n### Patches\nhttps://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/abd7739298f974319e3cac3fd4fcd7f995b63e4c.patch\n\n### Workarounds\nUpdate to version 1.1.2 or apply this patches manually\nhttps://github.com/pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle/commit/abd7739298f974319e3cac3fd4fcd7f995b63e4c.patch\n", "methods": ["Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Translations.", "Uncontrolled search path element through sprintf() parsing of translation strings."]}
