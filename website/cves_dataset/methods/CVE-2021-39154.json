{"description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39154](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39154.html).\n\n### Credits\nka1n4t found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n", "methods": ["An attacker can execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code from a remote host by manipulating the processed input stream."]}
