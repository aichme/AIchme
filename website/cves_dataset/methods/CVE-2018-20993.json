{"description": "Affected versions of this crate did not prevent deep recursion while deserializing data structures. This allows an attacker to make a YAML file with deeply nested structures that causes an abort while deserializing it. The flaw was corrected by checking the recursion depth.", "methods": ["Used uncontrolled recursion to cause a denial of service (DoS) while deserializing data structures.", "Exploited a flaw in the deserialization of deeply nested structures."]}
