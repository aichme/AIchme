{"description": "All versions of `passport-cognito` are vulnerable to Improper Authorization. The package fails to properly scope the variables containing authorization information, such as access token, refresh token and ID token. This causes a race condition where simultaneous authenticated users may receive authorization tokens for a different user. This would allow a user to take actions on another user's behalf.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix is currently available. Consider using an alternative package until a fix is made available.", "methods": ["Exploited a vulnerability in a package to gain unauthorized access to another user's account.", "Leveraged a race condition to obtain authorization tokens for a different user.", "Failed to properly scope authorization information, allowing unauthorized access."]}
