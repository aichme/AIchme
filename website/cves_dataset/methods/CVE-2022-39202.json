{"description": "### Impact\n\nIRC allows you to specify multiple modes in a single mode command. Due to a bug in the underlying matrix-org/node-irc library, affected versions of matrix-appservice-irc perform parsing of such modes incorrectly, potentially resulting in the wrong user being given permissions.\n\nMode commands can only be executed by privileged users, so this can only be abused if an operator is tricked into running the command on behalf of an attacker.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRefrain from entering mode commands suggested by untrusted users. Avoid using multiple modes in a single command.\n\n### References\n\n- https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/13/security-release-of-matrix-appservice-irc-0-35-0-high-severity\n\n### Credits\n\nDiscovered and reported by [Val Lorentz](https://valentin-lorentz.fr/).\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory email us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).", "methods": ["Used a bug in the matrix-org/node-irc library to perform incorrect parsing of mode commands.", "Tricked an operator into running a mode command on behalf of an attacker.", "Executed mode commands with multiple modes in a single command."]}
