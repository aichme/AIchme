{"description": "Jenkins Ansible Plugin allows the specification of extra variables that can be passed to Ansible. These extra variables are commonly used to pass secrets.\n\nAnsible Plugin 204.v8191fd551eb_f and earlier stores these extra variables unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThese extra variables can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nAdditionally, the job configuration form does not mask these extra variables, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.\n\nAnsible Plugin 205.v4cb_c48657c21 masks extra variables displayed on the configuration form, and stores them encrypted once job configurations are saved again.", "methods": ["Stores unencrypted extra variables in job config.xml files on the Jenkins controller.", "Stores extra variables in plain text in job config.xml files on the Jenkins controller.", "Allows users with Item/Extended Read permission to view extra variables.", "Allows access to the Jenkins controller file system to view extra variables.", "Does not mask extra variables displayed on the configuration form.", "Stores extra variables encrypted once job configurations are saved again."]}
