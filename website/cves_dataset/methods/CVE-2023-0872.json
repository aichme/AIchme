Meridian and Horizon installation instructions state that they are intended for installation within an organization's private networks and should not be directly accessible from the Internet.\n\nOpenNMS thanks\u00a0Erik Wynter for reporting this issue.", "methods": ["Exploited a privilege elevation vulnerability in the Horizon REST API.", "Used a vulnerable version of OpenNMS Horizon (31.0.8 and earlier).", "Required upgrading to a patched version (32.0.2 or newer).", "Used a vulnerable endpoint (users endpoint) in the Horizon REST API."]}
