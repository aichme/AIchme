{"description": "### Impact\nWhen [printing a tensor](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/807cae8a807960fd7ac2313cde73a11fc15e7942/tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.cc#L1200-L1227), we get it's data as a `const char*` array (since that's the underlying storage) and then we typecast it to the element type. However, conversions from `char` to `bool` are undefined if the `char` is not `0` or `1`, so sanitizers/fuzzers will crash.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [1be743703279782a357adbf9b77dcb994fe8b508](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1be743703279782a357adbf9b77dcb994fe8b508).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, TensorFlow 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability was discovered via internal fuzzing.\n", "methods": ["Fuzzing was used to discover the vulnerability.", "Internal fuzzing was used to discover the vulnerability."]}
