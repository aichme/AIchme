Existing [Configuration as Code](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/) configurations are still supported, but exports will emit the new property.", "methods": ["Used a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Jenkins Dashboard View Plugin.", "Exploited a vulnerability in a web application (Jenkins Dashboard View Plugin) to inject malicious code.", "Used a web application vulnerability to execute arbitrary code."]}
