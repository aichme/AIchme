{"description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker has sufficient rights to execute commands of the host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nXStream 1.4.18 uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for general purpose.\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-39144](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-39144.html).\n\n### Credits\n\nCeclin and YXXX from the Tencent Security Response Center found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Email us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)\n", "methods": ["Used a Remote Command Execution attack to execute commands on the host.", "Manipulated the processed input stream to execute commands.", "Used a whitelist to limit the types of input allowed.", "Used a blacklist by default, which cannot be secured for general purpose.", "Used a security framework to secure the input stream.", "Executed payloads using PowerShell commands.", "Used direct Windows system calls by leveraging Dumpert.", "Used malicious DLLs to setup persistence in the Registry Key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current Version\\Run."]}
