{"description": "Jenkins HashiCorp Vault Plugin 360.v0a_1c04cf807d and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials printed in the build log from Pipeline steps like `sh` and `bat`, when both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- The credentials are printed in build steps executing on an agent (typically inside a `node` block).\n\n- Push mode for durable task logging is enabled. This is a hidden option in Pipeline: Nodes and Processes that can be enabled through the Java system property `org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.steps.durable_task.DurableTaskStep.USE_WATCHING`. It is also automatically enabled by some plugins, e.g., OpenTelemetry and Pipeline Logging over CloudWatch.\n\nAn improvement in Credentials Binding 523.525.vb_72269281873 implements a workaround that applies build log masking even in affected plugins. This workaround is temporary and potentially incomplete, so it is still recommended that affected plugins be updated to resolve this issue.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Used Jenkins build logs to print credentials.", "Used hidden plugin options to enable durable task logging.", "Used Java system properties to enable hidden plugin options.", "Used credentials binding plugins to mask credentials in build logs.", "Used plugins to enable logging in cloud environments."]}
