{"description": "### Impact\n\nWe log the mail for invalid password reset attempts. \nAs the email is provided by a user and the api is public this can be used by an attacker to forge log entries.\nThis is vulnerable to https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html\n\nThis problem affects only application generated with jwt or session authentication. Applications using oauth are not vulnerable.\n\n### Patches\n\nversion 1.7.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIn `AccountResource.kt` you should change the line\n\n```kotlin\n log.warn(\"Password reset requested for non existing mail '$mail'\");\n```\n\nto \n\n```kotlin\n log.warn(\"Password reset requested for non existing mail\");\n```\n\n### References\n\n* https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html\n* https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Log_Injection\n* https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-log-forging\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [jhipster kotlin](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin)", "methods": ["Used CWE-117: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers to forge log entries.", "Used Log Injection to forge log entries.", "Used CWE-117: Improper Control of Resource Identifiers to allow an attacker to manipulate log entries."]}
