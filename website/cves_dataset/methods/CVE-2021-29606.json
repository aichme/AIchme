{"description": "### Impact\nA specially crafted TFLite model could trigger an OOB read on heap in the TFLite implementation of [`Split_V`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c59c37e7b2d563967da813fa50fe20b21f4da683/tensorflow/lite/kernels/split_v.cc#L99):\n\n```cc\nconst int input_size = SizeOfDimension(input, axis_value);\n``` \n\nIf `axis_value` is not a value between 0 and `NumDimensions(input)`, then the [`SizeOfDimension` function](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/102b211d892f3abc14f845a72047809b39cc65ab/tensorflow/lite/kernels/kernel_util.h#L148-L150) will access data outside the bounds of the tensor shape array:\n\n```cc\ninline int SizeOfDimension(const TfLiteTensor* t, int dim) {\n  return t->dims->data[dim];\n}\n```\n  \n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ae2daeb45abfe2c6dda539cf8d0d6f653d3ef412](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ae2daeb45abfe2c6dda539cf8d0d6f653d3ef412).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Heap OOB read in TFLite implementation of Split_V.", "Accessing data outside the bounds of the tensor shape array.", "Triggering an OOB read on heap."]}
