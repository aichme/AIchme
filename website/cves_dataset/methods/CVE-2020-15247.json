{"description": "### Impact\nAn authenticated backend user with the `cms.manage_pages`, `cms.manage_layouts`, or `cms.manage_partials` permissions who would **normally** not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the CMS due to `cms.enableSafeMode` being enabled is able to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP.\n\nThis is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not having `cms.enableSafeMode` enabled, but would be a problem for anyone relying on `cms.enableSafeMode` to ensure that users with those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute arbitrary PHP.\n\n### Patches\nIssue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nApply https://github.com/octobercms/october/compare/106daa2930de4cebb18732732d47d4056f01dd5b...7cb148c1677373ac30ccfd3069d18098e403e1ca to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 469.\n\n### References\nReported by [ka1n4t](https://github.com/ka1n4t)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [hello@octobercms.com](mailto:hello@octobercms.com)\n\n### Threat assessment:\n<img width=\"1108\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-10 at 1 21 13 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7253840/95663316-7de28b80-0afb-11eb-999d-a6526cf78709.png\">", "methods": ["An authenticated user with specific permissions can write arbitrary PHP code.", "The user can bypass the Twig sandbox.", "The vulnerability is patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.", "A manual patch is available at https://github.com/octobercms/october/compare/106daa2930de4cebb18732732d47d4056f01dd5b...7cb148c1677373ac30ccfd3069d18098e403e1ca."]}
