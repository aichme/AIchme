{"description": "### Effect\nAny user with edit rights can edit all pages in the `CKEditor' space. This makes it possible to perform a variety of harmful actions, such as\n- removing technical documents, leading to loss of service\n- Editing the javascript configuration of CKEditor, leading to persistent XSS\n\n### Patches\nThis issue has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and XWiki 15.1.\nThis issue has been patched on the CKEditor Integration extension 1.64.9 for XWiki version older than 14.6RC1.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe issue can be fixed manually by restricting the `edit` and `delete` rights to a trusted user or group (e.g. the `XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group), implicitly disabling those rights for all other users.\nSee https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/9d9d86179457cb8dc48b4491510537878800be4f\n\n### References\n- https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20590\n- https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/CKEDITOR-508\n- https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/9d9d86179457cb8dc48b4491510537878800be4f\n\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n*    Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n*    Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Used Cross-site Scripting (XSS) through CKEditor Configuration pages.", "Removed technical documents, leading to loss of service.", "Edited the javascript configuration of CKEditor, leading to persistent XSS.", "Restricted edit and delete rights to a trusted user or group to fix the issue."]}
