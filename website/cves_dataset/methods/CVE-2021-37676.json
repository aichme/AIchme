{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause undefined behavior via binding a reference to null pointer in `tf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n  \ntf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior()\ntf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows(\n  indices = tf.constant([], shape=[0, 0], dtype=tf.int64),\n  values = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64),\n  dense_shape = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64),\n  default_value = 0)\n```\n  \nThe shape inference [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/core/ops/sparse_ops.cc#L608-L634) does not validate that the input arguments are not empty tensors.\n\n### Patches \nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [578e634b4f1c1c684d4b4294f9e5281b2133b3ed](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/578e634b4f1c1c684d4b4294f9e5281b2133b3ed).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang of Baidu Security", "methods": ["Reference binding to nullptr in shape inference.", "Use of empty tensors in `tf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows`."]}
