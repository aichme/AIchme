{"description": "Jenkins Katalon Plugin 1.0.32 and earlier implements an agent/controller message that does not limit where it can be executed and allows invoking Katalon with configurable arguments.\n\nIt allows attackers able to control agent processes to invoke Katalon on the Jenkins controller with attacker-controlled version, install location, and arguments. Attackers additionally able to create files on the Jenkins controller (e.g., attackers with Item/Configure permission could archive artifacts) can invoke arbitrary OS commands.\n\nKatalon Plugin 1.0.33 changes the message type to controller-to-agent, preventing execution on the controller.", "methods": ["Allows invoking Katalon with attacker-controlled version, install location, and arguments.", "Allows invoking arbitrary OS commands.", "Allows creating files on the Jenkins controller.", "Allows execution of agent/controller message without limitations."]}
