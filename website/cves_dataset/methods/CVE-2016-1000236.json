{"description": "Affected versions of `cookie-signature` are vulnerable to timing attacks as a result of using a fail-early comparison instead of a constant-time comparison. \n\nTiming attacks remove the exponential increase in entropy gained from increased secret length, by providing per-character feedback on the correctness of a guess via miniscule timing differences.\n\nUnder favorable network conditions, an attacker can exploit this to guess the secret in no more than `charset*length` guesses, instead of `charset^length` guesses required were the timing attack not present. \n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to 1.0.4 or later.", "methods": ["Uses a fail-early comparison instead of a constant-time comparison.", "Provides per-character feedback on the correctness of a guess via miniscule timing differences.", "Allows an attacker to guess the secret in no more than `charset*length` guesses."]}
