{"description": "### Impact\nOn Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a git.bat or git.exe file in the current directory, that program would be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This does not affect Unix systems.\n\nThis is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-27955.\n\nThis issue occurs because on Windows, [Go includes (and prefers) the current directory when the name of a command run does not contain a directory separator](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38736).\n\n### Patches\nThis version should be patched in v2.13.2, which will be released in coordination with this security advisory.\n\n### Workarounds\nOther than avoiding untrusted repositories or using a different operating system, there is no workaround.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Start a discussion in [the Git LFS discussion page](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/discussions).\n- If you cannot open a discussion, please email the core team using their usernames at `github.com`.", "methods": ["Executes arbitrary code on Windows by running a malicious git.bat or git.exe file in the current directory.", "Uses the current directory as the execution path for a Git binary on Windows.", "Executes arbitrary code on Windows due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-27955."]}
