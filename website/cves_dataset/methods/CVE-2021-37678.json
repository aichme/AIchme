{"description": "### Impact\nTensorFlow and Keras can be tricked to perform arbitrary code execution when deserializing a Keras model from YAML format.\n\n```python\nfrom tensorflow.keras import models\n\npayload = '''\n!!python/object/new:type\nargs: ['z', !!python/tuple [], {'extend': !!python/name:exec }]\nlistitems: \"__import__('os').system('cat /etc/passwd')\"\n'''\n  \nmodels.model_from_yaml(payload)\n```\n  \nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/python/keras/saving/model_config.py#L66-L104) uses `yaml.unsafe_load` which can perform arbitrary code execution on the input.\n\n### Patches\nGiven that YAML format support requires a significant amount of work, we have removed it for now.\n\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information \nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Arjun Shibu.", "methods": ["Used arbitrary code execution via YAML deserialization.", "Used `yaml.unsafe_load` to perform arbitrary code execution on the input.", "Removed YAML format support due to the risk of arbitrary code execution.", "Patched the issue in GitHub commit 23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012."]}
