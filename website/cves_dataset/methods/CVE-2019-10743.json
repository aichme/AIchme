{"description": "All versions of archiver allow attacker to perform a Zip Slip attack via the \"unarchive\" functions. It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a \"../../file.exe\" location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\n### Specific Go Packages Affected\ngithub.com/mholt/archiver/cmd/arc", "methods": ["Used path traversal to exploit the \"unarchive\" function in MHolt Archiver.", "Exploited a Zip Slip attack via a specially crafted zip archive.", "Overwrote an executable or configuration file with a file containing malicious code.", "Executed arbitrary code."]}
