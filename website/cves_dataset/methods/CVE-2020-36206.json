{"description": "Affected versions of rusb did not require UsbContext to implement Send and Sync. However, through Device and DeviceHandle it is possible to use UsbContexts across threads. This issue allows non-thread safe UsbContext types to be used concurrently leading to data races and memory corruption. The issue was fixed by adding Send and Sync bounds to UsbContext.", "methods": ["Data races in rusb allow for concurrent use of non-thread safe UsbContext types.", "Memory corruption due to data races in rusb."]}
