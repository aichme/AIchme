{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker who can gain file access to the repository and modify metadata files may cause a denial of service to clients by creating many invalid signatures on a metadata file. Having a large number of signatures to verify will delay the moment when the client will determine the signature is not valid. This delay may be for at least a few minutes, but possibly could be longer especially if multiple files are impacted.\n\nThe tuf maintainers would like to thank Erik MacLean of Analog Devices, Inc. for reporting this issue.\n\n### Patches\nNo fix exists for this issue. \n\n### Workarounds\nNo workarounds are known for this issue.\n\n### References\n* [CVE-2020-6173](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6173)\n* [Issue #973](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf/issues/973)", "methods": ["Modified metadata files to create invalid signatures, causing a denial of service to clients.", "Modified repository files to delay client signature verification.", "Used file access to modify repository files.", "Used file access to modify metadata files."]}
