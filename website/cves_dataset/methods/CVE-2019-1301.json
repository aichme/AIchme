{"description": "## Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1301: Denial of Service Vulnerability in .NET Core\n\n# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-1301: Denial of Service Vulnerability in PowerShell Core\n## Executive Summary\n\nA denial of service vulnerability exists when PowerShell Core or .NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a PowerShell Core scripts.\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core handles web requests.\n\nSystem administrators are advised to update PowerShell Core to an unaffected version (see [affected software](#user-content-affected-software).)\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nPlease [open a support question](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Issue-Question&template=Support_Question.md&title=Support+Question) to discussion the PowerShell aspects of this advisory.\nPlease use dotnet/announcements#121 for discussion of the .NET aspects this advisory.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-software\">Affected Software</a>\n\nThe vulnerability affects PowerShell Core prior to the following versions:\n\n| PowerShell Core Version | Fixed in          |\n|-------------------------|-------------------|\n| 6.1                     | 6.1.6               |\n| 6.2                     | 6.2.3               |\n| 7.0                     | unaffected               |\n\n## Advisory FAQ\n\n### How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf all of the following are true:\n\n1. Run `pwsh -v`, then, check the version in the table in [Affected Software](#user-content-affected-software) to see if your version of PowerShell Core is affected.\n1. If you are running a version of PowerShell Core where the executable is not `pwsh` or `pwsh.exe`, then you are affected.  This only existed for preview version of `6.0`.\n\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\n\nFollow the instructions at [Installing PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core,\nplease email details to secure@microsoft.com.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.\nThis is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/.\nThe Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements)\nwill contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\n\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\n\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core.\nThis should be treated as a temporary measure.\nTherefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nPaul Ryman of VMware Sydney Engineering Team\n\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\n\nSee [acknowledgments](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/acknowledgments) for more information.\n\n### External Links\n\n[CVE-2019-1301](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-1301)\n\n### Revisions\n\nV1.0 (September 12, 2019): Advisory published.\n\n*Version 1.0*\n*Last Updated 2019-09-12*", "methods": ["Used denial of service attacks against PowerShell Core scripts.", "Exploited a .NET Core web request handling vulnerability.", "Used PowerShell Core to execute malicious scripts.", "Used .NET Core to handle web requests.", "Updated PowerShell Core to an unaffected version to mitigate the vulnerability.", "Uninstalled and reinstalled a previous version of PowerShell Core to resolve issues with scripts or modules."]}
