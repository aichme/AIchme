{"description": "### Impact\nAn unsanitized input of Next.js SDK tunnel endpoint allows sending HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs and reflecting the response back to the user. This could open door for other attack vectors:\n* client-side vulnerabilities: XSS/CSRF in the context of the trusted domain;\n* interaction with internal network;\n* read cloud metadata endpoints (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.);\n* local/remote port scan.\n\nThis issue only affects users who have [Next.js SDK tunneling feature](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#configure-tunneling-to-avoid-ad-blockers) enabled.\n\n### Patches\nThe problem has been fixed in [sentry/nextjs@7.77.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sentry/nextjs/v/7.77.0)\n\n### Workarounds\nDisable tunneling by removing the `tunnelRoute` option from Sentry Next.js SDK config \u2014 `next.config.js` or `next.config.mjs`.\n\n### References\n* [Sentry Next.js tunneling feature](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#configure-tunneling-to-avoid-ad-blockers)\n* [The fix](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/9415)\n* [More Information](https://blog.sentry.io/next-js-sdk-security-advisory-cve-2023-46729/)\n\n### Credits\n* [Praveen Kumar](https://hackerone.com/mr_x_strange)", "methods": ["Used SSRF to send HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs.", "Used SSRF to reflect responses back to the user.", "Used SSRF to interact with internal network.", "Used SSRF to read cloud metadata endpoints (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).", "Used SSRF to perform local/remote port scan.", "Used SSRF to exploit client-side vulnerabilities (XSS/CSRF in the context of the trusted domain)."]}
