{"description": "# Impact\nLuxon's `DateTime.fromRFC2822() has quadratic (N^2) complexity on some specific inputs. This causes a noticeable slowdown for inputs with lengths above 10k characters. Users providing untrusted data to this method are therefore vulnerable to (Re)DoS attacks.\n\nThis is the same bug as Moment's https://github.com/moment/moment/security/advisories/GHSA-wc69-rhjr-hc9g\n\n# Workarounds\nLimit the length of the input.\n\n# References\nThere is an excellent writeup of the same issue in Moment: https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/6015#issuecomment-1152961973\n\n# Details\n`DateTime.fromRFC2822(\"(\".repeat(500000))` takes a couple minutes to complete.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerable library (Luxon) with inefficient regular expression complexity.", "Exploited a (Re)DoS vulnerability through untrusted input.", "Used input validation bypass through long input strings."]}
