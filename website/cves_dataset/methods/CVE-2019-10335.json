{"description": "The plugin adds metadata displayed on build pages during its operations.\n\nAny user content was not escaped, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability allowing users with Job/Configure permission, or attackers controlling API responses received from ElectricFlow to render arbitrary HTML and JavaScript on Jenkins build pages.\n\nBuild metadata is now filtered through a HTML formatter that only allows showing basic HTML, neutralizing any unsafe data. Additionally, all builds executed after the security update is applied will now properly escape content received from ElectricFlow.", "methods": ["Used stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Jenkins ElectricFlow Plugin.", "Used arbitrary HTML and JavaScript to render on Jenkins build pages.", "Used API responses from ElectricFlow to execute malicious code.", "Used user content to execute arbitrary code."]}
