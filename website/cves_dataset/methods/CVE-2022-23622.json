{"description": "### Impact\n\nWe found a possible XSS vector in the `registerinline.vm` template related to the `xredirect` hidden field. \nThis template is only used in the following conditions:\n  - the wiki must be open to registration for anyone\n  - the wiki must be closed to view for Guest users (more specifically the XWiki.Registration page must be forbidden in View for guest user)\n\nA way to obtain the second condition is when administrators checked the \"Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page rights\" box in the administration rights.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is patched in versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, 13.10.3.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are two main ways for protecting against this vulnerability, the easiest and the best one is by applying a patch in the `registerinline.vm` template, the patch consists in checking the value of the xredirect field to ensure it matches the following:\n```\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"xredirect\" value=\"$escapetool.xml($!request.xredirect)\" />\n```\n\nIf for some reason it's not possible to patch this file, another workaround is to ensure \"Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page rights\" is not checked in the rights and apply a better right scheme using groups and rights on spaces. \n\n### References\n\nhttps://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19291\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki](https://jira.xwiki.org)\n* Email us at [security mailing list](mailto:security@xwiki.org)\n", "methods": ["Used a cross-site scripting (XSS) vector in the `registerinline.vm` template.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the `xredirect` hidden field.", "Used a template injection technique to inject malicious code.", "Exploited a condition where the wiki is open to registration for anyone and closed to view for Guest users.", "Used a hidden field to inject malicious code."]}
