{"description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nIf you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-21350](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-21350.html).\n\n### Credits\nThe vulnerability was discovered and reported by threedr3am.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)", "methods": ["An attacker can execute arbitrary code by manipulating the input stream.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code without user interaction.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code by manipulating the input stream without a whitelist.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code by manipulating the input stream with a default blacklist.", "An attacker can execute arbitrary code by manipulating the input stream with a vulnerable version of XStream (prior to 1.4.16)."]}
