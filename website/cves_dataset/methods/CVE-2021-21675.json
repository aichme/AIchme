{"description": "Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.12 and earlier does not require POST requests to request and apply changes, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.\n\nThese vulnerabilities allow attackers to create requests and/or have administrators apply pending requests, like renaming or deleting jobs, deleting builds, etc.\n\nJenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.13 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints. This was partially fixed in requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.8 to require POST requests for some of the affected HTTP endpoints, but the endpoint allowing administrators to apply pending requests remained unprotected until 2.2.13.", "methods": ["Used a CSRF vulnerability in Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin to create requests and apply changes.", "Exploited a vulnerability to rename or delete jobs, delete builds, etc.", "Used an unprotected HTTP endpoint to apply pending requests.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Jenkins requests-plugin Plugin 2.2.12 and earlier."]}
