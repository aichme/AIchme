{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe power level parsing within gomatrixserverlib was failing to parse the `\"events_default\"` key of the `m.room.power_levels` event, defaulting the event default power level to zero in all cases.\n\nIn rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level had been changed, this could result in events either being incorrectly authorised or rejected by Dendrite servers.\n\n### Patches\n\ngomatrixserverlib contains a fix as of commit `723fd49` and Dendrite 0.9.3 has been updated accordingly.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nMatrix rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level has not been changed from the default of zero are not vulnerable.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, e-mail us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).", "methods": ["Incorrectly parsed event default power level in gomatrixserverlib and Dendrite.", "Incorrect authorization of events in rooms where the `\"events_default\"` power level had been changed.", "Defaulting the event default power level to zero in all cases."]}
