{"description": "An issue was discovered in the cache crate through 2020-11-24 for Rust. \nAffected versions of this crate unconditionally implement Send/Sync for `Cache<K>`.\nThis allows users to insert `K` that is not Send or not Sync.\n\nThis allows users to create data races by using non-Send types like `Arc<Cell<T>>` or `Rc<T>` as `K` in `Cache<K>`. It is also possible to create data races by using types like `Cell<T>` or `RefCell<T>` (types that are `Send` but not `Sync`).\nSuch data races can lead to memory corruption.\n", "methods": ["Created data races in cache by using non-Send types as keys.", "Created data races in cache by using Send but not Sync types as keys."]}
