{"description": "### Impact\nThere is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control rules (document-level security, field-level security and field masking) where they are not correctly applied to the queries during extremely rare race conditions potentially leading to incorrect access authorization. For this issue to be triggered, two concurrent requests need to land on the same instance exactly when query cache eviction happens, once every four hours.\n\n### Affected versions\nOpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.9 and 2.0.0-2.6.0\n\n### Patched versions\nOpenSearch 1.3.10 and 2.7.0\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact AWS/Amazon Security via our issue reporting page (https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/) or directly via email to aws-security@amazon.com. Please do not create a public GitHub issue.", "methods": ["Exploitation of a race condition in OpenSearch fine-grained access control rules.", "Incorrect access authorization due to incorrect application of access control rules."]}
