{"description": "Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Send for types used in queue implementations (InnerSend<RW, T>, InnerRecv<RW, T>, FutInnerSend<RW, T>, FutInnerRecv<RW, T>).\n\nThis allows users to send non-Send types to other threads, which can lead to data race bugs or other undefined behavior.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in v0.1.7 by adding T: Send bound to to the Send impl of four data types explained above.", "methods": ["Implemented Send for non-Send types in queue implementations.", "Allowed sending non-Send types to other threads.", "Caused data race bugs or undefined behavior.", "Added T: Send bound to Send impl of four data types."]}
