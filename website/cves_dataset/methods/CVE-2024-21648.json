{"description": "### Impact\n\nThe rollback action is missing a right protection: it means that a user can rollback to a previous version of the page to gain rights they don't have anymore. \nThis vulnerability impacts all version of XWiki since rollback action is available. \n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.16, 15.5.3 and 15.8-rc-1 by ensuring that the rights are checked before performing the rollback. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere's no workaround for this vulnerability, except paying attention to delete old versions of documents that could allow users to gain more rights. \n\n### References\n\n* JIRA ticket: https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-21257\n* Commit: [4de72875ca49602796165412741033bfdbf1e680](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/4de72875ca49602796165412741033bfdbf1e680)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [Jira XWiki.org](https://jira.xwiki.org/)\n* Email us at [Security Mailing List](mailto:security@xwiki.org)", "methods": ["Missing protection on rollback action allows users to gain rights they don't have anymore.", "Users can rollback to a previous version of the page to gain rights they don't have anymore.", "No protection on rollback action impacts all versions of XWiki.", "Rights are not checked before performing the rollback."]}
