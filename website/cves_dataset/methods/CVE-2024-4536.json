{"description": "In Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, in the [EDC Connector component](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector), an attacker might obtain OAuth2 client secrets from the vault.\n\nIn Eclipse Dataspace Components from version 0.2.1 to 0.6.2, we have identified a security vulnerability in the EDC Connector component ( https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Connector ) regarding the OAuth2-protected data sink feature. When using a custom, OAuth2-protected data sink, the OAuth2-specific data address properties are resolved by the provider data plane. Problematically, the consumer-provided clientSecretKey, which indicates the OAuth2 client secret to retrieve from a secrets vault, is resolved in the context of the provider's vault, not the consumer. This secret's value is then sent to the tokenUrl, also consumer-controlled, as part of an OAuth2 client credentials grant. The returned access token is then sent as a bearer token to the data sink URL.\n\nThis feature is now disabled entirely, because not all code paths necessary for a successful realization were fully implemented.\n\n", "methods": ["Used OAuth2 client secret disclosure to obtain sensitive information.", "Used OAuth2 client credentials grant to obtain access tokens.", "Used bearer tokens to authenticate to data sinks.", "Used secrets vault to store sensitive information."]}
