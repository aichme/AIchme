{"description": "# Overview\n\nVersions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library could be misconfigured so that legacy, insecure key types are used for signature verification. For example, DSA keys could be used with the RS256 algorithm. \n\n# Am I affected?\n\nYou are affected if you are using an algorithm and a key type other than the combinations mentioned below\n\n| Key type |  algorithm                                    |\n|----------|------------------------------------------|\n| ec           | ES256, ES384, ES512                      |\n| rsa          | RS256, RS384, RS512, PS256, PS384, PS512 |\n| rsa-pss  | PS256, PS384, PS512                      |\n\nAnd for Elliptic Curve algorithms:\n\n| `alg` | Curve      |\n|-------|------------|\n| ES256 | prime256v1 |\n| ES384 | secp384r1  |\n| ES512 | secp521r1  |\n\n# How do I fix it?\n\nUpdate to version 9.0.0. This version validates for asymmetric key type and algorithm combinations. Please refer to the above mentioned algorithm / key type combinations for the valid secure configuration. After updating to version 9.0.0, If you still intend to continue with signing or verifying tokens using invalid key type/algorithm value combinations, you\u2019ll need to set the `allowInvalidAsymmetricKeyTypes` option to `true` in the `sign()` and/or `verify()` functions.\n\n# Will the fix impact my users?\n\nThere will be no impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you already use a valid secure combination of key type and algorithm. Otherwise,  use the  `allowInvalidAsymmetricKeyTypes` option  to `true` in the `sign()` and `verify()` functions to continue usage of invalid key type/algorithm combination in 9.0.0 for legacy compatibility. \n\n", "methods": ["Misconfigured library usage.", "Insecure key type usage.", "Legacy key usage.", "Insecure algorithm usage.", "Insecure key type and algorithm combinations.", "Invalid key type/algorithm value combinations.", "Legacy keys usage with RS256 algorithm.", "Legacy keys usage with DSA keys."]}
