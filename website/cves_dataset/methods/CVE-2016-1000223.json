{"description": "Affected versions of the `jws` package allow users to select what algorithm the server will use to verify a provided JWT. A malicious actor can use this behaviour to arbitrarily modify the contents of a JWT while still passing verification. For the common use case of the JWT as a bearer token, the end result is a complete authentication bypass with minimal effort.\n\n\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 3.0.0 or later.", "methods": ["Manipulated JWT contents to bypass authentication.", "Exploited a vulnerable library (jws) to achieve authentication bypass."]}
