{"description": "### Impact\n\nDue to the underlying implementation of `.ToString()`, it's possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript, or to achieve a denial-of-service, if a binding parameter is a crafted Object.\n\nUsers of `sqlite3` v5.0.0 - v5.1.4 are affected by this.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in v5.1.5. All users are recommended to upgrade to v5.1.5 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n* Ensure there is sufficient sanitization in the parent application to protect against invalid values being supplied to binding parameters.\n\n### References\n\n* Commit: https://github.com/TryGhost/node-sqlite3/commit/edb1934dd222ae55632e120d8f64552d5191c781\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n* Email us at [security@ghost.org](mailto:security@ghost.org)\n\nCredits: Dave McDaniel of Cisco Talos", "methods": ["Used code injection to execute arbitrary JavaScript.", "Achieved denial-of-service.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the implementation of `.ToString()`."]}
