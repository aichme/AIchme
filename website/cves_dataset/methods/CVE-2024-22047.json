{"description": "In certain setups with threaded web servers, Audited's use of `Thread.current` can incorrectly attributed audits to the wrong user. \n\nFixed in 5.3.3. \n\nIn March, @convisoappsec noticed that the library in question had a Race Condition problem, which caused logs to be registered at times with different users than those who performed the genuine actions.\n\n- The first issue we identified was from November 2021: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/issues/601 \n- So the solution was implemented in the following Pull Request: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/669 \n- And the feature was published in version 5.3.3: RELEASE: https://github.com/collectiveidea/audited/pull/671\n", "methods": ["Used a Race Condition to incorrectly attribute audits to the wrong user.", "Exploited a vulnerability in a threaded web server to cause logging errors."]}
