This issue has been fixed in Symfony 2.3.35, 2.6.12, and 2.7.7. Note that no fixes are provided for Symfony 2.4 and 2.5 as they are not maintained anymore. Symfony 2.8 and 3.0 haven't been released yet and the fix will be included in their first stable releases.", "methods": ["Session fixation via \"Remember Me\" login feature.", "Impersonation of the victim towards the web application.", "Exploitation of a session fixation vulnerability."]}
