{"description": "### Impact\nThe vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.\n\n### Patches\nIf you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the [Security Framework](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#framework), you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.\n\n### Workarounds\nSee [workarounds](https://x-stream.github.io/security.html#workaround) for the different versions covering all CVEs.\n\n### References\nSee full information about the nature of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it in XStream's documentation for [CVE-2021-21341](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-21341.html).\n\n### Credits\nThe vulnerability was discovered and reported by threedr3am.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [XStream](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues)\n* Contact us at [XStream Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/xstream-user)", "methods": ["Manipulated input stream to allocate 100% CPU time.", "Leveraged CPU type or parallel execution for Denial of Service.", "Used a whitelist with minimal required types for security framework.", "Used a blacklist with version 1.4.16 or later for security framework.", "Implemented workarounds for different versions covering all CVEs.", "Used a security framework with a whitelist and blacklist.", "Executed a payload to manipulate the input stream."]}
