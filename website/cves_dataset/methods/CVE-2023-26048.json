{"description": "### Impact\nServlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and a very large content.\n\nThis happens even with the default settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part content to disk.\n\nAn attacker client may send a large multipart request and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`.\nHowever, the server may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time.\n\nA very large number of parts may cause the same problem.\n\n### Patches\nPatched in Jetty versions\n\n* 9.4.51.v20230217 - via PR #9345\n* 10.0.14 - via PR #9344\n* 11.0.14 - via PR #9344\n\n### Workarounds\nMultipart parameter `maxRequestSize` must be set to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).\nLimiting multipart parameter `maxFileSize` won't be enough because an attacker can send a large number of parts that summed up will cause memory issues.\n\n### References\n* https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/issues/9076\n* https://github.com/jakartaee/servlet/blob/6.0.0/spec/src/main/asciidoc/servlet-spec-body.adoc#32-file-upload\n", "methods": ["May cause OutOfMemoryError by sending a large multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and a very large content.", "May cause OutOfMemoryError by sending a very large number of parts.", "May cause the server to recover after OutOfMemoryError and continue its service, although it may take some time."]}
