{"description": "### Impact\nThe implementation of `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` is vulnerable to an integer overflow issue caused by converting a signed integer value to an unsigned one and then allocating memory based on this value.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\ntf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad(\n  gradients=[1.0,2.0],\n  input=[1.0,1.0],\n  input_min=[0.0],\n  input_max=[10.0],\n  axis=-100)\n```\n\nThe [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L126) uses the `axis` value as the size argument to `absl::InlinedVector` constructor. But, the constructor uses an unsigned type for the argument, so the implicit conversion transforms the negative value to a large integer.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/96f364a1ca3009f98980021c4b32be5fdcca33a1).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, and TensorFlow 2.4.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.", "methods": ["Used integer overflow vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.", "Used implicit conversion to unsigned type to transform negative value to large integer.", "Used GitHub commit to patch the issue.", "Used cherrypick to apply patch to older versions (TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3).", "Used security guide for more information on security model and contact information."]}
