{"description": "Next.js is a React framework. Starting with version 10.0.0 and prior to version 12.1.0, Next.js is vulnerable to User Interface (UI) Misrepresentation of Critical Information. In order to be affected, the `next.config.js` file must have an `images.domains` array assigned and the image host assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided SVG. If the `next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other than default, the instance is not affected. Version 12.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, change `next.config.js` to use a different `loader configuration` other than the default.\n\n### Impact\n- **Affected**: All of the following must be true to be affected\n  - Next.js between version 10.0.0 and 12.0.10\n  - The `next.config.js` file has [images.domains](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#domains) array assigned\n  - The image host assigned in [images.domains](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#domains) allows user-provided SVG\n- **Not affected**: The `next.config.js` file has [images.loader](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#loader-configuration) assigned to something other than default\n\n### Patches\n[Next.js 12.1.0](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v12.1.0)\n\n### Workarounds\nChange `next.config.js` to use a different [loader configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#loader-configuration) other than the default, for example:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'imgix',\n    path: 'https://example.com/myaccount/',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nOr if you want to use the [`loader`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#loader) prop on the component, you can use `custom`:\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'custom',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n", "methods": ["Used UI Misrepresentation of Critical Information to exploit a vulnerability in Next.js versions between 10.0.0 and 12.1.0.", "Exploited a vulnerability in Next.js by using a user-provided SVG in the `images.domains` array.", "Used a default `images.loader` configuration to be affected by the vulnerability.", "Used a non-default `images.loader` configuration to be not affected by the vulnerability.", "Used a patch in Next.js 12.1.0 to fix the vulnerability.", "Used a workaround by changing the `next.config.js` file to use a different `loader configuration` other than the default."]}
