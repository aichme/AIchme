{"description": "Parsedown before 1.7.2, when safe mode is used and HTML markup is disabled, might allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code if a script (already running on the affected page) executes the contents of any element with a specific class. This occurs because spaces are permitted in code block infostrings, which interferes with the intended behavior of a single class name beginning with the language- substring.", "methods": ["Used a vulnerability in Parsedown to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.", "Executed code by manipulating element contents.", "Exploited a flaw in Parsedown's safe mode with HTML markup disabled.", "Used a script to execute the contents of an element with a specific class."]}
