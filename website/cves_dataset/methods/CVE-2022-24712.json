{"description": "### Impact\nThis vulnerability might allow remote attackers to bypass the CodeIgniter4 CSRF protection mechanism. \n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to v4.1.9 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nThese are workarounds for this vulnerability, but **you will still need to code as these after upgrading to v4.1.9**.\nOtherwise, the CSRF protection may be bypassed.\n\n#### When Auto-Routing is Enabled\n1. Check the request method in the controller method before processing.\n\nE.g.:\n```php\n        if (strtolower($this->request->getMethod()) !== 'post') {\n            return $this->response->setStatusCode(405)->setBody('Method Not Allowed');\n        }\n```\n\n#### When Auto-Routing is Disabled\nDo one of the following:\n1. Do not use `$routes->add()`, and [use HTTP verbs in routes](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/incoming/routing.html#using-http-verbs-in-routes).\n2. Check the request method in the controller method before processing.\n\nE.g.:\n```php\n        if (strtolower($this->request->getMethod()) !== 'post') {\n            return $this->response->setStatusCode(405)->setBody('Method Not Allowed');\n        }\n```\n\n### References\n- [CodeIgniter4 CSRF protection](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/libraries/security.html#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf)\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/issues)\n* Email us at [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4/blob/develop/SECURITY.md)\n", "methods": ["Bypasses CSRF protection mechanism.", "Uses HTTP methods to check request method in controller method.", "Uses HTTP verbs in routes.", "Checks request method in controller method before processing."]}
