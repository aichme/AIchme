{"description": "### Impact\n\nDevelopers that use the REST API to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. When an anonymous user is first signed up using REST, the server creates session incorrectly, particularly the `authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified the session type as being created with a `password`.\n\nThe server currently doesn't use `createdWith` to make decisions on how things work internally, so if a developer isn't using `createdWith` directly, there's nothing to worry about. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on `createdWith` by using it directly.   \n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to version 4.5.1.\n\n### Workarounds\nDon't use the `createdWith` Session field to make decisions if you allow anonymous login.\n\n### References\nn/a", "methods": ["Uses incorrect session creation to bypass authentication checks.", "Misuses the `createdWith` field to incorrectly classify session type.", "Allows anonymous users to create sessions with incorrect authentication information."]}
