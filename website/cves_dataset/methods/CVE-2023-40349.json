{"description": "Jenkins Gogs Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at /gogs-webhook that can be used to trigger builds of jobs. In Gogs Plugin 1.0.15 and earlier, an option to specify a Gogs secret for this webhook is provided, but not enabled by default.\n\nThis allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs corresponding to the attacker-specified job name.\n\nAdditionally, the output of the webhook endpoint includes whether a job corresponding to the attacker-specified job name exists, even if the attacker has no permission to access it.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Used an unauthenticated access to trigger builds of jobs.", "Used information disclosure to determine if a job exists.", "Used a vulnerable plugin (Jenkins Gogs Plugin) to gain access."]}
