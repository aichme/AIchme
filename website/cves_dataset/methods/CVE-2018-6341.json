{"description": "Affected versions of `react-dom` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to validate attribute names in HTML tags which may lead to Cross-Site Scripting in specific scenarios. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser. To be affected by this vulnerability, the application needs to:\n- be a server-side React app\n- be rendered to HTML using `ReactDOMServer`\n- include an attribute name from user input in an HTML tag\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf you are using `react-dom` 16.0.x, upgrade to 16.0.1 or later.  \nIf you are using `react-dom` 16.1.x, upgrade to 16.1.2 or later.  \nIf you are using `react-dom` 16.2.x, upgrade to 16.2.1 or later.  \nIf you are using `react-dom` 16.3.x, upgrade to 16.3.3 or later.  \nIf you are using `react-dom` 16.4.x, upgrade to 16.4.2 or later.", "methods": ["Used Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.", "Used user input to include malicious attribute names in HTML tags.", "Used server-side React app rendered to HTML using `ReactDOMServer` for exploitation."]}
