{"description": "There's a stack overflow leading to a crash when Trust-DNS's parses a malicious DNS packet. Affected versions of this crate did not properly handle parsing of DNS message compression (RFC1035 section 4.1.4). The parser could be tricked into infinite loop when a compression offset pointed back to the same domain name to be parsed. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious DNS packet which when consumed with Trust-DNS could cause stack overflow and crash the affected software.", "methods": ["Used a malicious DNS packet to cause a stack overflow and crash the affected software.", "Exploited a parsing flaw in the DNS message compression (RFC1035 section 4.1.4).", "Tricked the parser into an infinite loop by pointing a compression offset back to the same domain name."]}
