{"description": "An issue was discovered in the OATHAuth extension in MediaWiki before 1.31.9 and 1.32.x through 1.34.x before 1.34.3. For Wikis using OATHAuth on a farm/cluster (such as via CentralAuth), rate limiting of OATH tokens is only done on a single site level. Thus, multiple requests can be made across many wikis/sites concurrently.", "methods": ["No C2 infrastructure was used.", "No emails with malicious attachments were sent.", "No PowerShell commands were executed.", "No direct Windows system calls were made.", "No malicious DLLs were used.", "No persistence was setup in the Registry Key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current Version\\Run.", "The OATHAuth extension in MediaWiki was not implementing rate limiting."]}
