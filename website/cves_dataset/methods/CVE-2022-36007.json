{"description": "### Impact\nA partial path traversal issue exists within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list of load paths.\n\nAssuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ \"/Users/foo/resources\" ]` \n\nWhen passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine:\n`(load-resource \"test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\n`(load-resource \"../resources-alt/test.png\")`   => rejected, outside the load path\n\nWhen passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths:\n`(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\n`(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\" !!!\nThe latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability.\n\nThis issue\u2019s scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `\"/Users/foo/resources\"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also from `\"/Users/foo/resources-alt\"`, but not from `\"/Users/foo/images\"`.\n\nVersions of Venice before and including v1.10.16 are affected by this issue.\n\n### Patches\nUpgrade to Venice >= 1.10.17, if you are on a version < 1.10.17\n\n### Workarounds\nIf you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the functions that can be used in Venice with a sandbox. If it is appropriate, the functions `load-file` and `load-resource` can be blacklisted in the sandbox.\n\n### References\n  * [PR](https://github.com/jlangch/venice/pull/4/commits/c942c73136333bc493050910f171a48e6f575b23)\n \n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [GitHub Venice](https://github.com/jlangch/venice)\n* Email us at [juerg.ch](mailto:juerg.ch@ggaweb.ch)\n\n### Credits\n\nI want to publicly recognize the contribution of [Jonathan Leitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) for reporting this issue.", "methods": ["Used Partial Path Traversal to load files outside the configured load paths.", "Used absolute paths to bypass load path restrictions.", "Used load paths to load resources from unintended locations.", "Used functions `load-file` and `load-resource` to load files from arbitrary locations."]}
