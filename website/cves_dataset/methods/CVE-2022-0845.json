{"description": "PyTorch Lightning version 1.5.10 and prior is vulnerable to code injection. An attacker could execute commands on the target OS running the operating system by setting the `PL_TRAINER_GPUS` when using the `Trainer` module. A [patch](https://github.com/pytorchlightning/pytorch-lightning/commit/8b7a12c52e52a06408e9231647839ddb4665e8ae) is included in the `1.6.0` release.", "methods": ["Used code injection to execute commands on the target OS.", "Used a vulnerable library (PyTorch Lightning) to inject code."]}
