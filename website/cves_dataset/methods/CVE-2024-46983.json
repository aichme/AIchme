{"description": "### Impact\nSOFA Hessian protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components.\n\n### Patches\nFixed this issue by update blacklist, users can upgrade to sofahessian version 3.5.5 to avoid this issue.\n\n### Workarounds\nYou can maintain a blacklist yourself in this directory `external/serialize.blacklist`.\n", "methods": ["Used a gadget chain to bypass blacklist protection mechanism.", "Used deserialization to execute malicious code.", "Used a blacklist bypass to execute arbitrary code.", "Used a vulnerability in the SOFA Hessian protocol to execute code."]}
