{"description": "### Impact\nWhen decoding a resource handle tensor from protobuf, a TensorFlow process can encounter cases where a `CHECK` assertion is invalidated based on user controlled arguments. This allows attackers to cause denial of services in TensorFlow processes.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [14fea662350e7c26eb5fe1be2ac31704e5682ee6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/14fea662350e7c26eb5fe1be2ac31704e5682ee6).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.", "methods": ["Denial of Service (DoS) via assertion invalidation in TensorFlow processes.", "User-controlled arguments used to cause DoS."]}
