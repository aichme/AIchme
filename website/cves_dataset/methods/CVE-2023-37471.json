{"description": "### Impact\nOpenAM up to version 14.7.2 does not properly validate the signature of SAML responses received as part of the SAMLv1.x Single Sign-On process. Attackers can use this fact to impersonate any OpenAM user, including the administrator, by sending a specially crafted SAML response to the SAMLPOSTProfileServlet servlet.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem has been patched in  OpenAM 14.7.3-SNAPSHOT and later\n\n### Workarounds\nOne should comment servlet `SAMLPOSTProfileServlet` in web.xml or disable SAML in OpenAM\n```xml\n<servlet>\n    <description>SAMLPOSTProfileServlet</description>\n    <servlet-name>SAMLPOSTProfileServlet</servlet-name>\n    <servlet-class>com.sun.identity.saml.servlet.SAMLPOSTProfileServlet</servlet-class>\n</servlet>\n...\n<servlet-mapping>\n    <servlet-name>SAMLSOAPReceiver</servlet-name>\n    <url-pattern>/SAMLSOAPReceiver</url-pattern>\n</servlet-mapping>\n```\n\n### References\n#624\n", "methods": ["Impersonation of a user by sending a specially crafted SAML response to the SAMLPOSTProfileServlet servlet.", "Exploitation of a vulnerability in OpenAM up to version 14.7.2."]}
