{"description": "Versions of `converse.js` prior to 1.0.7 for 1.x or 2.0.5 for 2.x are vulnerable to User Impersonation. The package provides an incorrect implementation of [XEP-0280: Message Carbons](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0280.html) that allows a remote attacker to impersonate any user, including contacts, in the vulnerable application's display. This allows for various kinds of social engineering attacks.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nIf you're using `converse.js` 1.x, upgrade to 1.0.7 or later.\nIf you're using `converse.js` 2.x, upgrade to 2.0.5 or later.", "methods": ["Used User Impersonation to impersonate any user, including contacts, in the application's display.", "Conducted Social Engineering attacks."]}
