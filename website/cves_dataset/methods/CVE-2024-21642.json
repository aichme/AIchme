{"description": "### Impact\nUsers hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to server-side request forgery (SSRF) allowing attackers to access files on the server.\n\n### Patches\nUsers should upgrade to version 3.9.0 where the \"Load From the Web\" input is turned off by default. You can find out more information on how to turn it back on [here](https://github.com/man-group/dtale?tab=readme-ov-file#load-data--sample-datasets)\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only workaround for versions earlier than 3.9.0 is to only host D-Tale to trusted users.\n\n### References\nSee \"Load Data & Sample Datasets\" [documentation](https://github.com/man-group/dtale?tab=readme-ov-file#load-data--sample-datasets)\n", "methods": ["Used SSRF to access files on the server.", "Used Web uploads to exploit SSRF.", "Used a workaround to host D-Tale to trusted users.", "Used a patch to upgrade to version 3.9.0."]}
