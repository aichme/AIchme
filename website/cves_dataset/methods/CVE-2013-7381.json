{"description": "Versions 1.0.3 and earlier of libnotify are affected by a shell command injection vulnerability. This may result in execution of arbitrary shell commands, if user input is passed into libnotify.notify.\n\nUntrusted input passed in the call to libnotify.notify could result in execution of shell commands. Callers may be unaware of this.\n\n### Example\n```js\nvar libnotify = require('libnotify')\nlibnotify.notify('UNTRUSTED INPUT', { title: \\\"\\\" }, function () {\n    console.log(arguments);\n})\n```\n\nSpecial thanks to Neal Poole for submitting the pull request to fix this issue.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nUpdate to version 1.0.4 or greater", "methods": ["Command and Control (C2) infrastructure setup using a blog and WordPress.", "Spear phishing via emails with malicious Microsoft Office documents and PDFs.", "Command and Control (C2) infrastructure setup using PowerShell commands.", "Windows API abuse via Dumpert.", "Persistence via malicious DLLs in the Registry Key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Current Version\\Run.", "Command injection via untrusted input in a JavaScript call to libnotify.notify."]}
