{"description": "Jenkins Swarm Plugin allows clients to auto-discover Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request. Responses to this request are XML documents.\n\nSwarm Plugin does not configure the XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allows unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.\n\nAs of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.", "methods": ["Used XXE to read arbitrary files from the Swarm client.", "Conducted denial-of-service attacks against the Swarm client.", "Exploited a vulnerability in the Jenkins Swarm Plugin via UDP broadcast response."]}
