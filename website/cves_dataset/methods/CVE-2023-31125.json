{"description": "### Impact\n\nA specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process.\n\n```\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'handlesUpgrades')\n    at Server.onWebSocket (build/server.js:515:67)\n```\n\nThis impacts all the users of the [`engine.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/engine.io) package, including those who uses depending packages like [`socket.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io).\n\n### Patches\n\nA fix has been released today (2023/05/02): [6.4.2](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/releases/tag/6.4.2)\n\nThis bug was introduced in version 5.1.0 and included in version 4.1.0 of the `socket.io` parent package.
