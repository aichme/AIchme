{"description": "A cross-site request forgery flaw was found in etcd 3.3.1 and earlier. An attacker can set up a website that tries to send a POST request to the etcd server and modify a key. Adding a key is done with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can't PUT from an HTML form or such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.", "methods": ["Used a website to send a POST request to the etcd server.", "Attempted to modify a key in the etcd server.", "Created in-order keys to be sent to the etcd server."]}
