{"description": "## Withdrawn Advisory\nThis advisory has been withdrawn because the advisory concerns the repository https://github.com/onionshare/onionshare, which is not in a [supported ecosystem](https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/README.md#supported-ecosystems). [onionshare-cli](https://pypi.org/project/onionshare-cli/) is not affected by this issue.\n\n## Original Description\nThe `debug_mode` function in `web/web.py` in OnionShare through 1.3.1, when `--debug` is enabled, uses the `/tmp/onionshare_server.log` pathname for logging, which might allow local users to overwrite files or obtain sensitive information by using this pathname.", "methods": ["Used predictable pathname to obtain sensitive information.", "Used predictable pathname to overwrite files."]}
